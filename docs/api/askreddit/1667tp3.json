Specifically referring to adult diapers.\n\nMedical staff, and pharmacists, and media all bounce around this topic like \"Oh, the incontinence products are over there.\" and \"You should try some absorbent underwear\" or \"protection\".\n\nWe all know what they are. Stop bouncing around the term, they are diapers and call them diapers. And if you need them, accept that and use the proper term.\n\nIn my opinion, bouncing around the use of diapers as an adult and using these alternative terms just furthers to stigmatize and shame those that wear them.",

It's how I refer to my.. well, fanny, because it kinda turns me on how cute and naughty it seems. But it's kinda embarassing when I'm with a guy and ask him to 'lick my fanny' cause I know it gives some people the ick. I feel naughty saying it haha!",

The difference between the pairs you mentioned, and many others, is that one utilizes the vocal cords (voiced) and the others does not. Otherwise, the phonemes (sounds) are identical - that is, they’re pronounced in the same manner and position in the mouth.\n\nEvery language has its own set of sounds that it uses and others that it disregards. If a language doesn’t differentiate between for instance f and v, the speakers will likely perceive them as the same letter.",
