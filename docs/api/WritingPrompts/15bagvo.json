   "message": "Jinn Mayar sighed deeply while reflecting on humanities sordid past attempts at governing disparate cultures over the centuries. Compared tot he lunacy on display in front of her, humanity's past efforts were wildly successful. \n\nIn front of her the sentient gas filled jellyfish Ihili representative was futily beating the subterranean MukMukQu. Beating was a very generous word. All because the MukMukQu dared to pass gas in front of the Ihili, or so representative Oghpho claimed. Darren, the MukMukQu representative had let out a racious belch that impressed Jinns aid who remarked that he rated it at an 8.5 out of 10, and thus was now in a similar situation as Darren being 'assaulted' by Oghpho's aid. \n\nThis caused the Fublu representative to hoot in delight at the scene, earning them the ire of the typically stoic Crin, a feathered species capable of flight. The Crin flung a bone leftover from their meal at the Crin, but was intercepted by the cat-like Volin'ti'ahn'ver. Upset that their display of displeasure was interfered with, the Crin and Volin'ti'ahn'ver were now rolling on the ground in a dustball of feather and fur. This provided further entertainment to the baboon like Fublu rep who's hooting escalated to unbearable levels.\n\nAdjacent to them the skeleton-covered-in-jelly representative, Blrplrplrplrblr, grew annoyed at the Fublu and began making farting sounds in displeasure. Darting around chaotically was the Shleen delegation, a sentient swarm. Seeing an opportunity of the distracted Blrplrplrplrblr to finally get a taste of their jelly, causing the Blrplrplrplrblr aid to swat at the Shleen indignantly. \n\nAnd this is just a sample of the chaos that comprised of the Galactic council. Wearily Jinn extricated herself from the chaos and approached the nominal area of the Ihili, found their data slate and tapped hers to it, transferring a document. It took hours of avoiding bodily fluids, thrown food, gases, swinging appendages and worse to get her file transferred to several hundred of the representatives. Today marked the day she finally reached the critical number of 51% of the representatives to transfer the file to, a project that has been months of work. \n\nWork that would hand control of the Galactic council over to humanity and bring some sanity to the farce of a government  it is now. But first, Jinn needs to retreat to her ship and take a shower.",
