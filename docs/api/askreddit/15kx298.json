I ended up telling my mom when I got home because I felt guilty, we laughed it off. Then as I was walking to my room she made the comment “Well liv, I guess you’re a cutter in more ways than one!” And thought it was a riot. That is something that will always stay with me. It was so painful to have all of my pain dismissed in such a flippant way. I still hold that hurt.",
