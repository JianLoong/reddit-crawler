When one party doesnt, its time to sever.\"\n\nMy therapist told me this when I explained the relationships I have with two of my friends. With one friend we've wronged each other but we owned up to it and worked it out. This person is my best friend in the world! However, one friend I had would always flake out on me when we'd make plans and then I'd see them on snapchat partying with everyone that wasn't me. On top of that communication with this person was always poor on their end so then I decided I can play that game too. Haven't spoken to them since.",
