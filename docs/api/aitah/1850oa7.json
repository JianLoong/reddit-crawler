 "selftext": "I've been seeing this girl casually for a few weeks. We met at a club when a good friend of mine introduced us. We meet for sex once, maybe twice a week and we don't usually go on dates just to keep things minimal. Recently though, we went out a few times for drinks/bowling/mini golf just because she wanted to go out and do something. When we went out, she almost made it a point to wear as little as possible. Her entire rack busting out of her shirt and her cheeks hanging out of her shorts. It's nice to look at but that's not what I want in a long term partner. \n\nShe came over to my apartment a few days ago and she wanted to talk about our thing being more serious. I said no, I'm fine with our casual arrangement. She was a bit confused as we get along really well; why would I not want a relationship? Eventually after some bickering, I just said that I don't want to date her because of how she dresses. She asked me what was wrong with her fashion sense and I just said that there is nothing wrong with it; just not for me. I would like to date someone who dresses with a bit more class. No offense, just a personal preference. Let's just keep it casual between us. \n\nShe got offended and called me an insecure asshole and toxic for being uncomfortable with her expressing herself. I told her that there's nothing to be mad about, let's keep seeing each othe casually. Surely it's my right to have standards for a long-term partner. She kept calling me an asshole but I genuinely don't see how I could be the asshole. I was being upfront and honest from the get-go.",
