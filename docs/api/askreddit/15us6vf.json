Always had fun time doing that.",

After that, we would do some weeding and housekeeping before gathering our fruits and vegetables from the garden.\n\nThen we could bike to the neighbourhood library and get books we thought the other person would like. The evening would be spent reading, taking a stroll, cooking together, and possibly watching a movie.",
