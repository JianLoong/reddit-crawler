There is such a stigma and miseducation about these societal issues that fully makes those suffering feel more worthless than they already feel. At least, that was my experience.  \n\n\nShaming, humiliating, and downright treating people deplorably for issues they never wanted in the first place makes me ill inside. Basic human kindness doesn't seem to apply to those in the trenches of addiction/mental illness. We're the afterthoughts, the lost.  \n\n\nANYBODY can be afflicted with this. I had depression long before I had a drinking problem, which lost me health, a marriage (though ex was always abusive so there's that), and my sense of worth. I was the perfectionist, straight A student, overachiever. I've never tried any other drug (nicotine, weed, nothing) and drank socially until after 30. But after a baby and PPD hitting, my \"addictive\" personality masked itself and before I knew, I'm now an addict (alcoholic, though I prefer someone with a substance abuse disorder). It doesn't run in my immediate family, but signs were there. It was HELL for a few years, I truly wanted to die.   \n\n\nI learned quickly who loved me/accepted me unconditionally and who didn't. Extreme eye-opener, I don't recommend it. I'm now free of a toxic marriage and in-laws that judge everyone else except themselves. People who are just cruel human beings and enjoy the gleeful downfall of others. Same with some friends from that time. It is ugly and disgusts me to my core. Luckily, I've gained compassion, understanding, and support during all this too, but those who supposedly had my back and so cruelly cheered me on to possibly die, they can go to hell.",
