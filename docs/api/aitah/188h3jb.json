 "title": "AITAH for breaking up with my GF because of her ex who's her friend?",
 "selftext": "So my ex gf is friends with her ex, let's call him Mike. We dated for about 8 months.\n\nMike and my ex gf dated for about 2 years, and have been friends for like 6.\n\nThey broke up due to being incompatible as a couple.\n\nNow here's why I broke up with her.\n\nMike took every opportunity to show me up. Basically, he showed off how close he was with my ex. And how much better he knew her than me. \n\nFor example, one time he ran into us while we were having a date. We said hi, but he joined up, dude pulled up a chair and started talking about their relationship. How amazing their dates together were.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back, was when we were all hanging out with her friends.\n\nI mentioned wanting to travel to this city with my ex, Mike came in and said to my gf \"Hey, remember when we traveled to Europe?\" My gf said \"yeah\"\n\nMike then said, while looking at me \"Well, hardly traveled, we stayed in the hotel for hours and hours\"\n\nMy gf just laughed.\n\nI told my gf that I was feeling uncomfortable with how Mike was being, and asked her if she could tell him to  stop, or if at least she'd be OK with me asking him.\n\nShe asked me why?\n\nI told her I don't like that Mike shoves his previous relationship with her on my face.\n\nShe got defensive and said that Mike is her friend, and if I'm too immature to accept that girls can be friends with their ex's then I should just leave.\n\nSo I did.",

Some of the relationships go back 16 to 18 years. None of these women have I ever slept with.or anything sexual.\n\nI have had issues with their boyfriends in the past, but when they have found out that I have friendships with other women, for longer times, they no longer have issues. They just think that it's weird but acceptable. Besides when these women ask me to help them shop for gifts for their man, I'm always getting the right type of gifts: Gerber knife, DeWalt equipment, proper pirelli tires, masculine men things and they know that I picked it out for them.\n\nThe ones who have attempted to make it into something huge, are the ones that don't have any confidence in themselves. Again, to be clear, I have never kissed, petted, done anything sexual with my friends. \n\nNow my friends have shown up on my dates, just to gossip later, but they never did anything more than a kiss me on the cheek, and introduced herself as one of my friends. \n\nIf an ex-girlfriend of mine, had  shown up at the bar, while I was having a date, and if they would have attempted to join the conversation, I would have immediately told them to leave. The reason is simple, I am there, I am going to pay attention to the girl I am with, and I'm not about to open myself a can of problems by even dealing with an ex. Besides I'm trying to build a bridge, a potential long-term relationship, I don't want to set it up on fire. Bad enough I got the gossip group, and that would make a woman nervous, but I wouldn't dare, make my date feel secondary to any of the past women of my life.\n\nDon't forget you dump or get dumped by an ex. There is a good reason why you did it, or there is a good reason why it was done. Never repeat the same mistake twice. \n\nThat woman who let her ex-boyfriend, sit at your table, completely presented herself as someone that was willing to betray your trust. I can assure you, that if you were still dating that woman today, one of your companions would have photographed her making out with that guy who you dislike. And then you would have had to worry about potentially having an STD or something else because \"she got drunk, screwed up, and now wants to be forgiven\". \n\nUnless you have a consensual exclusive relationship where you have multiple partners just for sex, you cannot forgive when a person says they screwed up. People need to be held accountable and you did a fantastic job. \n\nI really can't be more happy for you, because you executed on your gut instinct, and a priorities of saying I want someone that will trust me and that I can trust. Obviously, she tried and failed to guilt you into something where you would be submissive to her wanting more people looking at her or that other guy. \n\nI hope many men, and many women, read your post, and behave appropriately in similar situations.",
