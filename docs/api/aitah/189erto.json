 "title": "AITA for preventing my husband from firing a pregnant employee?",
 "selftext": "I (F32) work with my husband (M35) in a small company he founded five years ago. He has 11 employees, including me. Both of us are managers and make decisions about hirings and firings.\n\nA few months ago, one of the employees (F25) told us she was pregnant. She's a good professional, but since she got pregnant, her performance has dropped a bit. She's also been absent more due to medical appointments and morning sickness. My husband got upset about this and started talking about firing her. He said she's not performing well enough and is harming the company.\n\nI was shocked by his attitude and tried to convince him to change his mind. I said he couldn't fire a pregnant woman, that it was inhumane and illegal. He said nothing in the law would stop him, which would be true, given that pregnant women have few labor rights. He said her pregnancy wasn't his problem and he shouldn't have to pay for it.\n\nI found that very cruel and selfish. I told him he was being a terrible boss and a terrible husband. I said that if he fired the pregnant employee, it could make me reconsider our relationship.\n\nHe became furious with me and said I was being dramatic and that I didn't understand anything about business, but he backed off from the idea of firing her. I'm very hurt and disappointed with him. I don't know how he can be so insensitive and unfair.\n\nI think I did the right thing by standing up for the employee, but he thinks I'm the one in the wrong. AITA?",
