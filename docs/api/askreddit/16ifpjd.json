My eye sight is fine for moving around day to day. But  minute details are just a blur.  I unplugged a couple of things from the motherboard, and can't remember where they go back into the motherboard.  I have resorted to the fact that I have to take my pc to the local shop and have them plug everything in.  I'm hoping while I wait, couldn't take more than 15 minutes?",
