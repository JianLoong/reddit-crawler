Throughout the day i shadowed a few people in the kitchen and out at the buffet but didn't really know what i was doing. At the end of shift my boss came back and asked how my first day was and said he hoped i learned a lot because I'd be opening and running the buffet alone tomorrow on 1st shift. I handed him my apron and told him good luck and walked out.",

I was being hired for their receptionist position and my desk sat in front of an opening that stood to about my chest (I'm 5'0).  \n\nCould not for the life of me understand why considering it was an office position where I would only really need to stand to use office equipment or set up the rooms for clients. The girl that was training me to be her replacement and I stood there for the entire 8 hour shift, often stagnant, while **all** other office staff s*at* at their desks. \n\nI texted the owner that evening to tell him that due to my flat feet it would be extremely difficult for me to stand, especially stagnant, for an entire 8 hour shift. Especially since the position had **zero** requirement for it. I even offered to pay for the seat. I explained that I would be alright with standing when required to, even if that meant I was moving around for most of my shift, but that having *no* opportunity to sit down seemed a little cruel.\n\nHe proceeded to go on a tirade about how that position had been a standing position for more than 20-years. Told me that sitting was bad for your back. He also told me that if I mirrored his other location he would see that I wouldn't be standing stagnant or even have the opportunity to sit down because the position requires a lot of movement. All this knowing that every other staff member, including him, were sitting for about 70% of that day. I quit on the spot.",

Sure enough, that was wrong and I was nearly detained in a Macy's bc that was the only way I could see how to get in. The store blasted house music all day long and it hurt my ears. When they weren't blasting music they were heavily pressuring me to buy a pair of updated Steve Madden shoes (I was required to wear a pair of recent Steve Madden shoes to work there, and mine were \"too old\"). I tried to avoid buying a pair as I just wanted to get through the shift and just call before my next shift and say that this wasn't for me.

Usually 3 days per hotel. \nI went to some hotels, for some shifts i had to get up at 4:30 and go by train and walk up a hill to be there on time. I did the full 3 days in every hotel except for one: \n\nMy shift started with a tour of the hotel and the rooms. I was told how the cleaning of the rooms had to be done. I was told that if the glasses by the sink looked okay, i shouldn't change them between visitors. The rest of the tour went ok. \n \nAfterwards, i was supposed to help with plates and the coffee machine in the hotel restaurant. When the waitress didn't need my help i was supposed to stand at the bar and smile, but i wasn't allowed to talk to guests. Even if they greeted me, i wasn't supposed to greet them back. Very weird request to begin with. \nThe boss was mad at me because i never worked a professional coffee machine before and he had to explain it to me. He did so while standing in his hotel kitchen, barefoot and chewing on a paperclip. His shoes were nowhere to be seen, every time i went back to the kitchen during my shift, he was barefoot. His shoes somehow appeared on his feet when he was in the guest room. The cook was alone for a restaurant filled with ~35 people and he was struggling. I wasn't allowed to help him, even though i had all the necessary hygiene certificates to work in a kitchen and had done kitchen work at home and in the other hotels i tried. I could've easily prepped salads or peel and cut potatoes. But i wasn't allowed. \nWhen a guest ordered coffee, the waitress told me, i went into the kitchen to make the coffee but i had to give the coffee to the waitress because i had to stay behind the bar and not talk to anybody. \nOne time i went to the kitchen and the hotel owner's elderly mom was screaming at him about being wasteful because of some reason i don't remember. Of course, he was barefoot. \n\nThe waitress and i were only allowed to take away empty plates and glasses after the guests left. They had to sit infront of their empty plates and sometimes multiple empty glasses until they left the restaurant. \n\nAfter the first few guests left and i could finally do something, i grabbed the plates, glasses, napkins etc. and went back to the kitchen. I put all the food scraps and the napkins in the trash and put the dirty dishes to the side where they would be taken care of, i don't remember how or who had to wash them. This went well until the boss saw me throw a \"PERFECTLY GOOD NAPKIN!!!\" in the trash. He then berated me on how everything costs money and that i should check every napkin. If it didn't have stains, i have to put it back with the clean ones to go to the next guest. \n\nI talked to the waitress when almost all guests were gone. She told me that she is stuck with this job because she doesn't have a car and thats basically the only job she can do without having to drive a car to get there. If there was better public transport, she would immediately leave and go to a better workplace, since the boss is always like this. Not working is no option for her since she has a young kid she has to feed. She told me to leave if i didn't want to end up like her. \nShe was very kind, but obviously very broken. \n\nI called in sick for the remaining 2 days of the deal, and reported everything i typed here to the program. \nI have made it a habit to visibly stain any napkin that is handed to me in a restaurant. \n \nWorking in the hotel industry for a few days has really shown me that this is not the way for me. I now work in childcare and this was the right decision for me.",

   "message": "Hired at a factory job back when I was 18-19ish, it was my first “real” non-fast food job.  It was a one person per shift forklift driver position.  Was told only 2nd shift was available, but I could apply to 1st shift whenever it opened up.\n\nFirst day I found out not only was 1st shift open, but I was expected to be the one that would train whoever they hired.\n\nAnd no I couldn’t take the 1st shift opening.  They wanted an “adult” to fill 1st shift.\n\nNot sure why they were surprised when I told them I wasn’t coming back for day 2.",

   "message": "I started work as a night auditor at a popular hotel chain in my city. I went in for training, feeling quite excited to get my \"foot in the door\" in the hospitality industry. The first words out of my trainer's mouth: \"Just so you know, you're going to get robbed while on the job. The night auditor basically gets held up at gunpoint every week here. Just give them the money and call the cops afterwards. Hopefully you don't get tied up and locked in the laundry room like the last night auditor.\" She was completely serious and had a kind of exhausted tone about it. I quit during my lunch break.",

   "message": "Lost my job during COVID and was looking for anything, as long as it paid more than unemployment was currently. I got accepted in a sales position at a local favorite furniture store. I asked how the commission worked and they told me that it was usually much faster than it was currently but commission doesn't pay out until the product is delivered and that COVID had expanded timelines to a 1-2 months, rather than a few weeks. \n\nOn my first day I was told that I had to purchase my own iPad to make sales on as the store only had 2 and they were used based on seniority. Not a deal breaker but super annoying this wasn't explained beforehand.\n\nLater, I was filling out paperwork in the break room and saw a bunch of manufacturer names written on a whiteboard with dates next to them. The closest date was 6 months out. I asked an employee what the dates meant and he said \"that's the expected date of delivery for each brand we carry\"\n\nI called my wife, we talked it through and both came to the conclusion that we couldn't afford for me to work for $10 an hour (less than my unemployment) for 6 months before seeing my first commission check. Left without saying anything and called the manager on the way home who said I was \"overreacting and would be sorry\".\n\nGot a much better job and was happy to have made the decision.",

   "message": "Oh my god I thought I could do car sales AHAHAHA. I applied on indeed and was working nights so I was excited for the change. Got my certification and even bought a new purse! \n\nI had no idea it was cold calling, I watched training videos my first two days which I was then told I didn’t need to watch, I was then given a list and told to call at least 60 people A DAY. I had no script, and no knowledge of what I can or can’t say outside of the Do Not Call training I’d chosen to do the day before lmao. I would be given leads trying to sell people cars WE DIDNT EVEN HAVE ON DISPLAY! I was the only employee that was getting leads to sell an antique mustang…BECAUSE IT WAS SO BEYOND REPAIR, OUR OWN SERVICE DEPARTMENT WOULDNT TOUCH IT!!!! We were to work 13hr days Saturday, everyone was late to meetings, I was shamed for working thru lunch to leave early on my birthday even!\n\n I made it more than a day because I was holding out hope, but I ended up not even lasting a month lmaooooo. No shade to anyone in sales but not all dealerships are like that right?!",

The meat packing plant where I stand on a step ladder for hours in the cold making sure the conveyer belt doesn't get jammed up with frozen chicken breasts? No thanks, new job. The warehouse with only 4 employees, none of whom I want to spend any time around? Next. \n\nFinally ended up at a food packaging factory where I was paid decent and got along well with my co-workers. Worked there a couple years.",
