My cousin who is like 26 had a couple of kids with a dude called Brody and he always went off about how he can't get a beard. Now that I think about I have a bigger and filled beard then other men 3 times my age. My father is the only person with a beard bigger than mine; maybe think duck dynasty beard.",

I went to a Mets game with my friend that summer a few weeks before. While at the game, my friend shows me his phone in shock. It was the news that Chester Bennington passed. \n\nI found out that Chester Bennington died in the exact location that I was set to see him a few weeks later.",
