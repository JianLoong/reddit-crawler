 "selftext": "My husband and I were arguing about paternity testing after reading lots of reddit stories about it. He said that men should be able to get it without judgement and I said that women should be trusted in a committed relationship.  I told him that if he wants DNA test then we should not have kids.\n\nHe came back to me with a blank page and told me to sign it. I asked him why?? and he told me that he wants it. I told him that I will never sign a blank paper ever. He asked me whether I think that he will use it for bad things or ever harm me. I said no, I dont. Then he told me that I should not worry and sign it and trust him.\n\nThen he said that he will not ask for DNA test because he trust me but I should also show my trust and sign on the blank paper. He said he will not have kids with me unless I do it.\n\nIts stupid, they are not equivalent, no one should sign a blank paper. Thats the first thing we are taught. He just tell me to trust him and sign it, says he needs to know his wife trust him completely before he can have children.\n\nI cant explain my viewpoint properly, he feels he got me. Am I wrong here?????",
