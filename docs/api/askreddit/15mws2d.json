After 12 hours I was suffering horrific diarrhoea. Every 10 minutes. \n\nMy butt was so sore that toilet paper felt like sandpaper, I was bleeding from the constant wiping etc. \n\nMy wife, being the angel she is, passed me in some aloe vera soft wipes that she had, suggesting I use the nice soft wipes to alleviate the pain. I was desperate. \n\nIt might have worked, except.....she actually passed me bleach wipes. I wiped me destroyed butt with friggin bleach wipes and screamed like a baby. \n\nSo, I'd say if you have a wrecked ass, don't use bleach wipes on it.",
