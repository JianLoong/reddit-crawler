All the while doing what I find interesting and lucky the salary is there to match.   This involves hours of downtime while experiments are incubation or thawing etc….. and I’d rather spend that time looking at weird posts then filling out my lab notebook.   Also involves hours of weekend nights analyzing datasets, but being married, that’s ok because it helps to escape the boss (wife) sometimes lol.  “I love you honey”",
