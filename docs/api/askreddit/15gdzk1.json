   "message": "I sold furniture for a while.  People always wanted a sofa that would last 30 years like the one they bought in the 70s or 80s.  I'd always take them to our heaviest set with the most durable leather imaginable, and they'd always say something about how expensive it was.  I'd then show them the exact same look at 1/20th the price and let them know they could get 5 to 10 years out of that one, and come back and buy something they like again when it wears out, and they'd nearly always go that route.  \n\nMy grandmother bought a microwave before I was born in 1981.  She still has that microwave and still uses it daily.  I've gone through approximately 7 microwaves over the last 24 years of being an adult on my own.  Same for refrigerators and freezers.  \n\nConsumer brands used to take pride in making quality products, but sometime around 1985 or 1990 they discovered that if you bought a durable product in year one, they couldn't sell you a replacement in year 5 and get more of your money.",

Ingredients were relatively good and everything tasted delicious. \n\nNowadays... don't even get me started. I've tried them all from Manchu Wok to Panda Express. Now they cost $15-20 for a 2 topping plate, where they skimp on giving you anything. Even if you end up getting the chicken, they basically contain 5% meat and 95% batter so it tastes like absolute shit.",
