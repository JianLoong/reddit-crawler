I didn't have to poop for a few days so I knew something was up.\n\nWhen it finally came time for the urge to come, I sat down and started pushing and instantly knew there was a BIG problem. I thought that since yogurt was soft that it would make soft poo but no, it did not.\n\nI pushed really hard and it wasn't started to come out but it wasn't going to get out. I didn't want to keep pushing really hard because that's how you get hemorrhoids. So I was stuck. I actually thought I would maybe have to go to the hospital because this giant thing was stuck in my colon, and I really didn't want to do that. \n\nSo, panicking, I sat up and felt around and felt the tip of it starting to come out. I turned the faucet on with my clean hand and then I tried to start picking it out with my fingers. I really had no other choice. \n\nI managed to pick some pieces off and the consistency was like dense clay. I not having fun here but I was making some progress. \n\nEventually, after picking pieces off, I sat down and tried to push again and it started to come out all on its own. \n\nWhat resulted was probably the closest thing to child birth that a man could experience. There was a lot of relief getting it out but I now had another problem: there's no way this giant thing could flush. It was about 3 times as large as a normally big-ish poo. It was massive. I even took a picture (and later deleted it).\n\nI was using the faucet to wash my fingers off and now I had to actually use them to break up this thing, and that's what I did. \n\nIt was a total mess. You when, if you've ever woken up in the middle of the night with a nose bleed and you take care of it in the bathroom, the next day you go to the bathroom and there's blood everywhere? It was kinda like that but with poo. It sucked. I eventually got all the pieces to flush and spent about 20 mins cleaning up the bathroom of what was left behind.\n\nSo I learned a lesson about what lots of dairy can do to you and some other lessons I didn't know or want to learn.\n\nEdit: I was not on pain killers",

   "message": "I started taking this new medication for anxiety, but it was really messing with my bowel movements. Not one shit I took was solid. Anyway, I was working a commercial roofing job for about 2 months, and that day we were working 23 stories up. This was a big project site, so lots of companies and people working in this building. \n\nI started feeling my guts bubble, and I ignored it, because of how long it would take me to go from the roof to the ground floor where the port-a-potties were. Suddenly, that bubble got worse. I went down the roof stairs, to go down 2 floors and radio the elevator operator. There was no answer, and the panic set in.\n\nNow, I'm looking everywhere for a toilet-shaped object in a construction-ridden hallway. I tucked back into a room that was being re-drywalled and before I shit myself, I dropped my pants and just blew ASSSSSSSS all over the wall and floor. I saved my pants though! I scrambled out of there quickly, and I walked down all 21 flights of stairs to make sure I cleaned up myself nice and good. I head back up to the roof and don't say a FUCKING word to anyone. Not even my brother who got me the job.  \n\nSuddenly, the dude running the whole project site comes up and asks if all of my boss's guys were up on the roof and says there's a site-wide meeting right now. We go down, there's gotta be like 60 people, and he is FURIOUSSSSS, and goes, \"ALRIGHT WHO DID IT???\". I fucking went full Lady Gaga poker face. \"SOMEONE SHIT ALL OVER MY WALL...THIS PERSON IS CLEARLY SICK. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING, JUST GO UP THERE NOW AND CLEAN IT UP\". My co-worker was like, \"Yo, that's gross\", and I was like \"tOTTALLY\".\n\nI never told this story to anyone, not even my wife. I quit that job shortly after.",

   "message": "TW:\n\nMy dad was involved in dog fighting when I was a child. It‚Äôs not something I talk to anybody about.\n\nI‚Äôll never forget our pitbull whiskey. She was a mean fighting machine. Of course, I never saw her that way because she was so loving at home. \n\nMy dad brought her (and I) to a house one day to fight her son. She completely shut down. She didn‚Äôt wanna fight him. She had never lost a fight until that day. She managed to survive but not without significant injury. I was devastated. It was my first and only dog fight I had witnessed and I was scarred. When leaving, I remember asking my dad questions. ‚ÄúWhy did whiskey have to fight?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo all dogs do that?‚Äù My dad was equally as devastated but probably not for the same reason. \n\nFast forward a few months Whiskey was doing better. We were sitting in the living room when a next-door neighbor girl came over with potato chips. Whiskey end up biting her in the face bad. \n\nMy dad knew what was going to happen next so he took her out back, told her to sit, and he shot her in the head. \n\nI 100% blame it on the dog fighting (and my father) \n\nMy dad cries anytime we‚Äôve ever talked about it. The guilt will forever be there. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt something I ever talk about with anybody  because my father is a changed man and he is still my father.\n\nEDIT: not weird‚Ä¶ just traumatic.",
