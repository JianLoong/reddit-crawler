Why though? We have so much useless spending and the government just makes sure only their special interest gets the money. \n\nTax the Uber rich? Yes, but the spending will go back into their pockets eventually. I believe they need to be taxed more but we need to start reinvesting in our economy. The whole infrastructure is based on a pay wall. \nYou want better school? Move to a rich neighborhood or private school. Want lower crime rate? Move to richer neighborhood (excluding white collar crimes). Etc.\n\nI am tired seeing all my tax dollars going to stuff which I never see in return. I am tired of all these government officials becoming millionaires during and after their tenure. I am sick of working until I am at an age where it hurts to wake up in the morning. I am tired of seeing that healthcare behind locked behind your company insurance. I am tired of being salary and working 50+ hours because they needed to log in and send them data. \n\nThere need to be new laws to say you can't make 400x your employees, fucking why do you need so much money? So you can give your kids kids kids kids kids kids' a second yacht? I am tired of thinking, man I could save money if we only go to the local parks instead of going on a actually vacation with the family. \n\nI am tired.",
