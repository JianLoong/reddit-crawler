 "selftext": "We(30s) recently got married and l noticed we both watch a bit of porn since we had no recent sexual partners before marriage. It became more obvious when he started watching porn as I gave him handjobs and BJs.  I didn't say anything because it was a quieter and quicker way to cum.  We live with his mom and now have long term guests.  For him, he said it gives him that extra 'motivation' to cum.\nI then noticed he preferred handjobs and BJs than penetration. When I asked him he said he prefers penetration but he can't really cum that way.  So I finish him off with BJs. And he has started to watch porn while we have intercourse.\nSo I proposed we watch less porn and not have sex everyday.  Every other day or just a bit of teasing and fondling on the inbetwern days.  He agreed and seemed fine.\nThat same day but at night we had fallen asleep but in the middle of the night we wanted to do it.  I was giving him a BJ and it seemed like he was really enjoying it.  He does every time.  But he asked if he could watch \"a video\"(porn).  I stopped and cleaned my face off.  And rolled over, cried(silently) mysekf to sleep.  He was silent.  He had spooned me but then turned around to sleep.  \nSo AITAH for stopping as soon as he asked to watch porn on the same day he agreed we should stop?\nHow would you handle this?",
