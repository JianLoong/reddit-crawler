 "selftext": "English is not my first language, so sorry for mistakes. \n\nOur (50f and 54m) youngest daughter (21f) went to college last year. At the same time my husband and me moved to another city both for his work and because we like this town better. I'v been a SAHM mostly since my kids were born, but I've managed to work a bit. Now I'm restarting my own business just for fun and to afford some extras. \n\nMy daughter is livid with us for moving and especially with me for working. She says we are selfish, as were supposed to stay near her, just as when her older brothers (27m, 25m) were studying. But we stayed only because we did not want to uproot her. She has made some new friends there and some of their moms are even taking time off job to support their kids. Is that a thing now? She calls us bad parents and threathens to block us. She needs money therefore she still communicates with us. \n\nAITA for moving after our daughter started studying  and wanting to live our lives and to fulfil our dreams?",
