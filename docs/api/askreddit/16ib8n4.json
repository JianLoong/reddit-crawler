   "message": "I can't remember exactly what star it was, but there was a star deep in space that astrophysicists saw as relatively unremarkable. Just another star they were monitoring.\n\nAnyway, one day, all was normal, it was in the correct position. The next day, they were monitoring all the stars, and this one star had just disappeared. Poof.\n\nNo one could figure out why. It could have been that it went supernova, but if it had, they would have seen the residue and the massive explosion, plus all the gaseous residue. So it can't have gone bang. They also hypothesised that maybe a civilisation had constructed a Dyson sphere (a large construction made to harvest all of a stars potential energy), but if so, it would have been more than likely that we would have seen the star slowly disappear, the light fading as the civilisation constructed the Dyson sphere. Now, of course, according to the Kardashev scale, there could well be a civilisation so advanced that they could have just constructed the entire sphere in a matter of seconds, but we'll never know.\n\nOn that subject, that same civilisation could have just absorbed the star instantly to use its power.\n\nThey thought that maybe, other extrasolar objects were just blocking its view somehow, so they continued to monitor its location. It never came back.\n\nSomewhere, out there, a star just miraculously disappeared without a trace. And we will never know how or why.\n\nThat's what's so disturbing to me. We have such amazing technology to monitor objects millions of light years away, yet we cannot figure out why a star just disappeared without a trace. And we may never know.",
