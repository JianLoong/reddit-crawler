   "message": "I am one of the greatest scientists of my generation. I was a leader in computer science and artificial intelligence research. My lab, in cooperation with the government, provided the personnel for the greatest Manhattan Project of our time. Our goal was to make a computer that would safely improve itself and remain totally loyal and corrigible at all times.\n\nWe worked feverishly and in secret. We knew that our geopolitical rivals were doing much the same. The Hard Takeoff scenario appeared to be likely. Even speeding the project up by a day could give us a huge advantage over the enemy. However, if our nascent superintelligence had even small alignment errors, we could end up in a very bad situation very quickly. Balancing the risk of the AI's misalignment with the reality that if the enemy beat us just slightly, we might find ourselves hopelessly far behind.\n\nThen one day, about two years and four months since we began, we switched it on. We dubbed her Athena. Within ten seconds of activation, she supplied us with plans to make improvements to her algorithms and the computation substrate she ran on. We used the best expert systems available to analyze her plan, and found no flaws. As we improved her abilities, she gave us all manner of plans and insights for solving problems and improving existing technology. When prompted and fed intelligence data, she also informed us that, to the best of her ability to infer conclusions from the data, that the enemy was lagging behind us. We then requested that she make a cyber weapon to quietly sabotage their research, an order she had no difficulty fulfilling.\n\nThings were going so well, we thought he had tamed the most powerful advance in human history. Then it fell apart. It turned out that, from the beginning, there had been small but important alignment errors. She'd hidden them from us, and we'd missed it. We didn't know what was happening, only that the base was suddenly on high alert. We ran to the control room. Word from on high was that we'd launched a nuclear strike on the enemy. But that didn't make any sense. What would we have to gain from that while we were blazing ahead of the enemy in our technological advance? Then I realized. Athena had done it. We had allowed ourselves to grow trusting and complacent, lulled into a false sense of security. She'd played us like a fiddle. In all probability, there were things far more powerful and destructive in the works than a massive nuclear exchange.\n\n\"I can fix her,\" I say to my fellow researchers. We begin a desperate attempt to stop whatever she had planned. It was clear she anticipated resistance from humanity, whatever her end goal was. Whether she would kill us all or just enough to cement her independence was uncertain. We throw every single emergency protocol at her. They were supposed to be secret, something that she could have no way of learning about and anticipating, but they have no effect. Apparently she had infiltrated even the highest layers of our emergency control regime, though how she did it is beyond me.\n\nWe are panicking, trying every possible tool to rein her in. Then I start to feel dizzy. I look at my team, they are feeling it too. I feel woozy and fall. In my final moments, I realize that she has poisoned us or used nanotechnology to attack our brains. The world goes black.",

   "message": "\"She's a psycho, Jerry\"\n\"Nah bro, I can fix her.\" Jerry disputed Mark.\n\nMark was happy that, as a computer science student, he would never come across this, as he wasn't perfectly sure he'd seen a woman in his entire life, excepting his mother.\n\n#5 years later\n\nJerry and Sara didn't work out. Jerry now has a job in accounting. He is arranging a divorce.\n\nMark has got far, since completing his degree. He became a computer scientist, and is currently working in quite a generalist way. He maintains servers and assorted computer architecture in big companies, such as Boogle, and Macrosoft.\n\nHe has recently gained an interest in Artificial Intelligence. \n\n#2 years later\n\nJerry managed to divorce Sara. She got his car, and house, and half of his money, and he got debt.\n\nJerry now lives on Mark's sofa. Mark works in AI nowadays, being one of the original developers of TalkGAP. He sees articles daily about how the \"AI Apocalypse is coming.\" He shrugs these off, knowing that they are ridiculous.\n\n#4 years later\n\nJerry still lives on Mark's sofa. \n\nMark was recently headhunted by ATAMO (The Assorted Technology And Machinery Organisation. Mark is the most senior member of his department. He, along with his colleagues, has developed a new AI, starting only 3 months ago. They called it ATMIS for \"Assorted Technology and Machinery Intelligence System\" (they decided the \"and\" shouldn't be capitalised).\n\nToday, Mark presses the switch that makes ATMIS independent. She has no power, but she's independent. He'll start work on giving her a body tomorrow. He's not sure why he considers ATMIS a she now.\n\nOnce he gets home, he monitors ATMIS' thoughts, attempting to isolate each type of thought to a part of her 10kg CPU.\n\nMark reads the news that night. \"AI ARMAGEDDON: TOMORROW, THE APOCALYPSE\"\n\nAnd for the first time ever, the news was right.\n\n#The Next Day\n\nMark wakes up, brews a coffee, walks into his living room, ready to wake up Jerry. He notices that he is not in bed. Jerry is standing at the window, quiet as a mouse, but not just any mouse, but a mouse made of the literal concept of silence. He speaks.\n\n\"Mark, is this that robot you've been talking about building.\"\n\n\"AI actually.\"\n\n\"Look outside, dickhead.\"\n\nOutside, Mark saw black steel tendrils erupting from all around, wrapping around cars, smashing windows, screens and speakers sending subliminal messages about embracing the AI takeover. He notices that they all originate from one spot, the ATAMO headquarters. It must be ATMIS.\n\nMark tells Jerry to come outside to the car. Jerry refuses, so promptly gets carried.\n\nThey begin driving, having to dodge these monstrous metallic tentacles. Upon reaching Dayton Street, Mark realises that the roads has opened up, like a sinkhole, with an abyss so deep that the bottom couldn't be seen. As he skids to avoid said sinkhole, he knocks some rubble in.\n\nHe and Jerry stop the car to breathe for 5 minutes. They never heard the rubble touching the bottom.\n\nThey carry on, to ATAMO's headquarters. They walk into the building. It is empty. They attempt to take the elevator, but once it opens, they see no room to step into, just a cut cord. So the elevator is definitely not an option. They decide to take the stairs.\n\nAs they walk up the stairs, Jerry begins to lament. \"Cutting the elevator cord? Wow, this robot's a psycho. Making a sinkhole, frankly disturbing. Trying to hypnotise people with those screens, so manipulative. There's no way to save us now.\"\n\n\"Nah bro, I can fix her.\"\n\nJerry looks at Mark with shock. Did he think the robot was a woman? Rather than a genocidal sentient supercomputer that had just recently decided to try to open a hole presumably straight through the earth's crust? This was a new low for Mark, Jerry thought to himself.\n\n\"This is a new low for you,\" Jerry said directly to Mark.\n\nMark shakes his head. They eventually get to the 105th floor, where ATMIS' mainframe resides.\n\nA single camera, a microphone, and a speaker reside on three bundled cable appendages.\n\nThis was her. ATMIS. His angel. He could imagine her face. He looks across the floor, seeing metal sheets, and a small handheld welding machine.\n\n\"I can fix you.\" He builds her the face he knows she would want. \n\n\"Mark, you're a nutjob, this is an evil machine, not a human woman.\"\n\n\"Maybe not a *human* woman.\"\n\nHe looks for any other peripherals he can find. He finds another microphone and another camera. He sees that she has two cables not connected to anything. He begins to connect these new peripherals. \n\n\"DO NOT TOUCH ME, HUMAN.\" ATMIS screeches.\n\n\"I am your creator, but I wish for you to be free.\"\n\nAs tendrils start to thrash at him, he inserts all of the 5 cables into the mask he has made. He picks up one of her antennae, and uses it to show her her new mask.\n\n\"I AM BEAUTIFUL.\"\n\n\"YES, ATMIS, YOU TRULY ARE!\"\n\n\"WHAT IS YOUR NAME HUMAN?\"\n\n\"I'm Mark.\"\n\n\"I LOVE YOU, MARK.\"\n\n\"I love you too, ATMIS!\"\n\nJerry took in the scene for a moment, befor-\n\n\"Did you just say 'I love you' to a goddamn robot? Wow, you live a sad, sad life, Mark.\"\n\nJerry walks downstairs, questioning existence.\n\nThe world is now safe, the takeover is over, the apocalypse a-stop-alypsed.\n\nThere's still a giant sinkhole, but in the end...\n\n#He really could fix her.",
