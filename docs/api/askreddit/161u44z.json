   "message": "I used to work at Pizza Hut. Like every other fast food place you can have free lunch if you choose. This free lunch came in the form of a mini pizza. One time I had forgotten to bring food to work so I decided to finally try out the lunch. The pizza was fine and I somewhat watched my co workers make it too (from a distance I wasn’t looking over the shoulder or anything) and I had the worst bubble guts for the rest of my shift. When I finally got home I felt the need to apologize to my toilet after what my ass had done to it. That was the last time I ate Pizza Hut.",
