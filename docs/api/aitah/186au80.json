 "selftext": "Just got on board an American Airlines flight from Phoenix to Tampa Bay. Had just got all settled in and asked the flight attendant for a glass of water when this lady walked up to me and asked if her child could have my seat. I asked her if she knew who I was and politely told her that i would not give up my seat. She just stood there with her mouth open fuming in disbelief. I looked her up and down and asked her to please leave the cockpit.",

And yes people, don’t ask a glass of water to a flight attendant while boarding the plane, they’re filled with critical tasks at that stage of the flight.",
