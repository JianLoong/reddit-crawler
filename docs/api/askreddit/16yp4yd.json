   "message": "My scarf.  I bought it from a market stall in Florence, Italy in 2009, and its been all around the world with me.  It's kept me warm on MANY airport floors and overnight buses. I've only been without it for a couple of weeks in the last 14 years, when I accidentally left it at a friend's house.\n\nIf I ever lose it/when it gets too ragged to wear, I will genuinely grieve for it. ðŸ˜­",
