   "message": "When I was 8 years old, we were driving from VA to VT to visit my grandparents. Somewhere along the way, my dad got pulled over.\n\nI had just recently figured out how to make myself burp (my signature burp phrase was \"ET phone home\"). So as soon as my dad rolls down the window, I'm like \" hey Mister, wanna see something funny\".\n\nMy dad about murdered me with his look in the rearview mirror, and my mom nearly took my head off shoving a coloring book and crayons at me. But the officer said YES, so I obliged.\n\nI burped the phrase \"put your hands up\" and got my dad out of a ticket because the cop about died laughing.\n\nSo while my parents probably thought it was the worst thing ever, my skills proved useful",
