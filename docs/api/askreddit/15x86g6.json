   "message": "Theoretically you could save it and brew it again, but it'd start to become bitter.  I don't drink coffee but I knew someone who'd do that with coffee grounds by saving yesterday's grounds and adding a sprinkle of fresh.  Others told me that was gross and they refused to drink their coffee at their house.\n\nI could imagine it'd be the same with tea.  If you're trying to stretch your grounds and the taste doesn't bother you, hold onto them and add a little fresh each time.  Others might not mind but others will, so don't expect much company if you do this, but if you're okay with it, save some money and tea",
