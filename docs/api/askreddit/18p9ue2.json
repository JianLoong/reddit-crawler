   "message": "Got an LOR (Letter of Reprimand) because I was late to an aircraft launch due to doing a task that my TSgt ordered me to do after I told him that he ordered me to do after I informed him that it would probably cause me to be late. I had to sprint across the flightline while carrying a bunch of equipment, and was able to knock out my portion of the launch procedure fast enough that the jet was still able to take off on time, meaning that the mission was not negatively impacted.\n\nI got chewed out, handed the LOR to sign, and decided to write a rebuttal (which is where you can explain the circumstances of what led to you getting in trouble, or admit guilt and own up to your mistake, OR throw your boss under the bus for being an ass. I went with the third option).\n\nWhen it was sent to the 1Sgt to be added to my file, the 1Sgt called me into his office to discuss it. I explained the situation, and he basically said \"Seriously? He gave you an LOR for following his orders AFTER you told him it was a bad idea? That's fucking stupid. I'm shredding this LOR. As far as I can tell, you did nothing wrong. Go back to your Section and tell him to come talk to me.\"",

Guy was power tripping all the time and threw his rank around, never offering solutions just problems and complaints.\n\nI trained him on how to do something, he remembered it differently, I confirmed with other people that my way was correct, and he chewed me out for being insubordinate for correcting him.  \n\nDude actually left the deployment with a bad review which is almost impossible to do without getting booted.",

I also got the upper hand on that one....the course was out of regs, so I politely-ish informed that the score could \"get lost\" or I would request mast. It got lost.\n\nOne of the biggest ass chewings for something dumb that I gave out was to a boot who showed up drunk to a driving course, under the legal age for drinking. Everyone not inside the main building heard me, and I went on for probably 15 minutes. Finished it off with a 6105 for good measure. \n\nI chewed out a gun team leader and fired him on the spot for pointing a mortar system downrange the wrong direction and he couldn't explain to me why it was aimed the way it was or how one of the firing chart he supposedly used worked, despite having clear instructions printed on the face of it.\n\nChewed that same boot a second time the same day because after I fired him, he self appointed himself to be the safety driver and relieved the one who's job it was, when only the range safety officer (myself) could appoint or relieve safety drivers.\n\nHad another, chewed him out because he couldn't figure out to drink water in the extreme heat. Then had to chew him out again because he turned around and drank too much water, and went down. Kid took an entire magazine of silver bullets because he couldn't figure out how to drink water correctly.\n\nThose were the days lol.",

We ended up setting off the environmental monitor designed to protect the equipment that we were working with.  A few times.  Even after we stopped the competition, the beans just kept working their way out. \n\nA few months later, we were even more bored and decided to do some medieval style jousting.  With on person on an office chair, with a mop and a bin lid.  Whilst being pushed by somebody else.  Of course, to make it more interesting.   We had to set fire to the mop and set off a load of smoke alarms.   As we had to be within X seconds of some equipment.",

The instruction allowed us to leave one pair of boots, shower shoes, PT/tennis shoes, and civilian shoes each at the foot of our beds. I made the switch to wear brown boots over my boot camp issued black boots since theyre far comfier so my black boots were left at the foot of my bed while I wore my brown boots. The reason the failed my room was because of my black boots being out. The dumbass PO1 who was NMT thought they were my dress shoes because they were shined so well. When I told him they were my boots he asked me how I would be out in uniform without them and I told him to look at my feet and tell me what he saw. He didnt like being wrong so instead he got on me for an \"attitude\"",

I GUESS I'M DOING THIS FOR MY -- HEALTH.  GET IN THE -- VEHICLES.  WE'RE LEAVING IN 5.
