She actually ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù to being a Robot in 2015 during an interview when she was asked why she never physically sweats. She went along with the ruse (she has a great sense of humour) and said she‚Äôs definitely a robot, but her truthers have got it all wrong. They thought Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made her, but she was actually designed by an anonymous contractor in his garage and she‚Äôs the only model left because they destroyed the prototypes.  \n\nOn these conspiracy sites I was reading about people who believe this, they think that when she has fainted in public before it‚Äôs because her batteries needed to be charged. I even saw one photo where the author had circles parts on the photo where the USB was behind her neck.  \n\nThis was even popular with the dumbest of America during inquiries into Benghazi and the private email server thing - she was able to withstand 14 hour interrogations without losing her cool, and smoked Donnie in all her debates with him. Rather than admit she has incredible stamina and self control, they say it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs an android and has an unfair advantage because she only gets tired or shows emotion when her power is low and she can run for almost 24 hours.  \n\nI kind of wish there was a black mirror episode or something like that, because if it turned out to be true I‚Äôd laugh my ass off.",

Or that the van Allen Belts are deadly to humans and that's why we only are in low earth orbit now.\n\nBoth are extremely obviously false.\n\n Rockets are comically bad at performance, but they don't need air. Their efficiency is measured in called specific impulse. Saturn V 1st stage was around 300s. A modern jet plane is about 3000s in its engines. That's how much air helps. But you can do it with rockets and their awful efficiency.\n\nAlso, the van Allen Belts actually extend into low earth orbit due to the ominously named South Atlantic Anomaly, where the magnetic field dips. The Apollo mission was also aware of the belts and wasted quite a bit of fuel to avoid the belts being going around them.",

In fact biologists were against applying this theory to humans to begin with. There are no human alphas. And what we believed to be alphas in animal populations like wolf packs turned out to just be parents and their packs just their pups. Alphas do no exist in nature. Where they do exist is within the confines of human made prisons.
