Pay yourself 15$ (to spend normally) pay your savings 15$ (and forget about it unless it's an absolute emergency) 20$ goes to necessities/credit and 50$ for bills. Don't fall into that trap of thinking you make the exact amount you get paid. \n\n\n\n\n2. Be responsible with credit, a solid cash back card with no annual fee and can extend your dollar further, make your payments on time and negotiate a lower APR every 6 months. \n\n\n\n\n3. Don't listen to all the social media BS about relationships, go out and try to find a partner and always be open to find love. Be pathetic and cheesy, don't ever be too cool for emotion. Loneliness is a killer, it warps your perception of people and corrupts you from the inside out ultimately making you a jaded and cynical person. A lot of platforms top performers prey on your loneliness. \n\n\n\n4. Work on your body. What you do in your teens and 20's will last you well into your 40s and 50s. Exercise, go to the gym, be active, take a class. It's a million times harder to fix yourself when you're older and are set in bad habits, your inner dialogue will want to try but at the slightest uncomfortable feeling you'll give up. \n\n\n\nAnd lastly always try to be a good friend and a good neighbor.

   "message": "Being good and kind does not automatically bring in physical rewards, so many people choose to be selfish. What they miss is that this does make their life **worse** by damaging their immediate community. When you're that person who treats people well and does good for goodness sake you build community which you can rely on when *you* need it. Sometimes it's helping a friend move, giving someone a ride or just offering a listening ear. Don't let people take advantage of you, but do what you can. It builds character and confidence in a way nothing else will. \n\nBalance that by knowing when to take care of **you**. Sometimes you need to put yourself first, and that's OK. Take time to yourself, buy yourself that little treat, say no when you really want to. It's all about balance, everything is. \n\nTrue friendships are some of the most rewarding relationships you will have. The secret to finding them is being ***so entirely yourself*** that kindred folks will be drawn to you. Be a little weird, be earnest and be honest. When you're comfortable being you other people will relax around you, and that's where the best relationships are built. Some people might not like you, but there's nothing you can do to please everyone so you might as well just be who you are and do what you like. \n\nListen, I mean really listen when people speak. Ask them follow up questions. Too many people wait to talk instead of actually listening to each other and it's amazing how much you miss out doing that. You learn so much more listening than talking. \n\nDo things you're bad at. I'm talking hobbies here- people immediately put down stuff because they're not good at it the second they pick it up. You have to be a bit resilient to get good at anything. You have to be bad at stuff before you're good at stuff. In the meantime do it for yourself, because you enjoy it. \n\nIn a similar vein, quit. If you don't like a book don't finish it. If your job is making you miserable look for a new one. If your friend is mean or your partner doesn't treat you with respect dump em. Too often we base success off of permanency, but it's a lie. You don't have to waste time being unhappy just because you've already spent some time doing it.\n\nLast of all, don't take yourself too seriously. Enjoy your life, enjoy your youth. It doesn't last, so make it count.",
