Yes, it was great that we all rode our bikes everywhere and knew what a mimeograph machine was and blah blah blah, but ffs, the world keeps moving and every day there are amazing new artistic, cultural, and technological developments. Looking at the world through a lens distorted by nostalgia ossifies your thinking. Nothing makes you act more like an old person than being absorbed by nostalgia.\n\nNostalgia is also easily manipulated. Look at all of the people who have used nostalgia for the (impossibly perfect) past as a way of getting older people to buy into retrograde politics and fear of (pick your group). Nostalgia isn't all bad, but pretty much categorically my contemporaries who have gone off into brain-dead crap like QAnon are always the ones who are beholden to nostalgia.",

They cling to beliefs that they sub consciously know aren't true but their pride prevents them from admitting it, even to themselves.  They refuse to even examine evidence that does not meet with their preconceptions or may be contrary to their own beliefs.  They grasp at straw men and hypotheticals to justify their beliefs while dismissing clear evidence of the contrary.",

   "message": "Not me- but my grandfather. Had bone cancer about 30 years ago. His bone was pretty much gone and I don’t remember exactly what the Dr did but because my grandfather was in his 70s the Dr refused to permanently repair the bone, saying this method lasts 10/12 years and my grandfather would not live that long. So…20 years later that young Dr in great shape drops dead and my grandfather loves to be in his late 90s. For his last 10 years all he ate was vanilla ice cream and I sometimes wonder if that helped make his bone strong. One day after my grandmother had been dead about 6 months,he called me and my mom (only child-as am I) and my dad and husband to come over. We did and he informed us he was ready to die and was going to start dying. I don’t understand how. He was perfectly healthy, still eating etc. still living life reg. He got a little weaker, we called Hospice, they said he’s healthy but let him go ahead and be in hospice because of his age. He laid in the bed and died a little every day for months. When he died Hospice said he wasn’t really sick he just decided is ready to die and started dying.",
