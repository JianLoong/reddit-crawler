 "selftext": "Me and my husband are recently married, and at the wedding I talked to one of my friends and his girlfriend about going out on a double date soon. I texted him later on wishing him a happy Thanksgiving and asked if he would still like to double with me and my husband. We settled on a date then he asked where we should go for dinner. I made a suggestion for a place that was fairly priced, but a little out of the way. But I also said I would be fine going somewhere closer to them. He made a different suggestion to a more expensive restaurant closer to where they lived. It wasn't a big deal to me or my husband so we agreed. \nWhen the waitress came over to ask if the checks were together or separate my friend and his girlfriend were a little quiet. My husband gestured to me and himself and told her we were on one check and my friend was on the other. My friend then looked at his girlfriend and made a face I can't describe. \nAfter we paid our separate checks my friend said how he \"was glad he didn't spend all his money so he could afford coming here\" and \"how it was more expensive than he thought it would be\". His check ended up being more expensive because he was ordering alcoholic drinks and no one else was drinking. \nAITA for not paying for another couple's meal on a double date just because i asked if they would go?",
