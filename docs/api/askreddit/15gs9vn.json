And what you add to that blend will probably depend on your preferences\n\nMaking a pizza? Well you want some super stretchy mozzarella for sure to give your cheese that stretch but then some sharp cheddar or aged Gouda to give it some character. \n\nDoing some nachos? Well you don’t need it to be stretchy or soft so can pick flavour alone , but it can’t become to hard when it’s cooked. So some cheddar is a good base and you can work in the flavour from some other cheeses to compliment the toppings you choose.\n\n\nFor me personally I find cheddar and Gouda to be mainstays and good workhorse cheeses , aged Gouda has phenomenal flavour for me so it’s great as a blend additive but alone it’s to dry and has no stretch",
