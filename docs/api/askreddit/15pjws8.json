You still have that. They will be whole coins that are purchasable for Pennies and you can let a computer mine more. When bitcoin hits 50k per bitcoin sell them all. \n\nAs far as women go you will not get a girlfriend until college so like just don‚Äôt sweat it. You will find the one in college by chance at a friends house if that somehow doesn‚Äôt happen she will be associated with x,y,and z persons. Her name is xxxxxx xxxxxx. You will almost certainly known these associates at 18 so keep up with them at least tangentially. Get you grandma and mom to buy these five stocks as much as they can and hide it. Hold on to your toys people actually pay more for them later. Do not listen to your dad about the future he‚Äôs so wrong it would be comical if not for being so sad. Also he and you are going to butt heads a lot. He‚Äôs got issues  just let him think he won. \n\nHug your family more and good luck because shit gets real fucked up sooner than you think but hopefully the extra money will help with that.",
