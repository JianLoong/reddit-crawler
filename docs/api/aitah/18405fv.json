 "selftext": "Posted here because it was removed from Aamitheasshole for some reason. \n\nSome guy tried to steal my motorcycle last night. He dropped it on himself and was injured enough that he could not get out from under it.\n\nMy dogs were going nuts so I went to the front window to see what was up. I found him pinned under my bike. He was in a fair bit of pain. He asked me to help get the bike off of him but I didn't want to get near him.\n\nI called the cops on the non emergency line and told them what happened. Cops showed up twenty minutes later. They called for an ambulance.\n\nMy mom said that I have no compassion and that he could have been seriously hurt. She has always hated my motorcycle. I told her that I had no compassion for thieves. We are now fighting and it is making thanksgiving weekend awesome. /s",

OR they ask the RP (you) what happened and you explain he was trying to steal the bike..ok he can have weapons or be a nutjob, the police usually clear the scene and declare it safe for EMS to show up.\n\ni actually had one instance where a bar fight broke out and someone asked for an ambulance and only told me that a guy fell and hit his head. policy says to only send EMS for falls.\n\nEMS show up and a bunch of drunks try to fight them because the dude knocked out allegedly groped a lady so they kicked his ass. my god was EMS mad at me over that.\n\nalso you have 0 obligation to help anyone thats what our taxes are for, you could fuck around and get permanment damage when you lift the bike off of him and he decides to sucker punch you or some dumb shit",
