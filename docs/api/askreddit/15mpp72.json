   "message": "I'm a 30 something year old Canadian and I still strongly support the defense and sovereignty of Ukraine. Overall I am glad my country is supporting Ukraine but disappointed in the amount of military support has allotted to be sent over, but given how poorly our own military is funded I would say that it was bound to happen. Still though I continue writing to my government representatives, as do several friends and family members to let them know how we feel.\n\n On a less positive but still optimistic note I know that Ukraine like most previously soviet nations struggles with government and military corruption. My hope is that Ukraine ramps up its efforts to weed out corrupt officials that are hurting the war effort from within. It's unfortunate that during a battle for the continued freedom of the Ukrainian people that some traitors are using the war as an opportunity to line their own pockets. Every aid package and piece of military hardware counts and it needs to be made sure that it's all getting to the people who need it.\n\n I wish the best of luck to Ukraine and look forward to their induction into NATO to make sure this never happens again. Fuck every russian or allied goon that supports this imperialist war.",
