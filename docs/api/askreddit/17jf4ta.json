   "message": "When I was a kid I used to visit my grandmother a lot. One day she gave me crackers and cheese to snack on. I was about to take a bite of a cracker when I looked down and saw something moving on it. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs bugs on this cracker!‚Äù My grandmother took a look: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there, eat your crackers.‚Äù But I insisted, so my aunt took a look: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there, eat your crackers.‚Äù But I continued to insist until my other aunt took a look. Sure enough, she saw little brown bugs crawling all over the crackers. \n\nMy aunt opened the box the crackers had come from: bugs. She pulled boxes from the cupboards and looked inside: more bugs. The whole kitchen was infested with little brown bugs. They were in the cookie tins, in the bread box, in the flour‚Ä¶ My aunt asked my grandmother, an avid baker, how she hadn‚Äôt noticed the colony of bugs that had taken over the white flour. Her response: ‚ÄúOh, I thought it was whole wheat!‚Äù\n\nThey ended up tossing out at least three garbage bags of food that night. The cupboards were bare when they were done. It seemed to take care of the problem but I was always a little weary about eating at my grandmother‚Äôs house after that.",

The food prepared by my bio-mom was so bad that it wasn't providing me with the nutrients or calories I needed to survive.  I went off to college where I had to cook for myself (I wasn't allowed to cook at home because my father insisted that \"cooking was women's work\")  Not only did I discover that food didn't have to be burnt to a crisp, flavorless, or boiled until everything was grey.  I also discovered that food can be made to taste good, and using things like salt, or pepper, spices, or various condiments can make it taste amazing.\n\nThe \"freshman 15\" likely saved my life.\n\nThe thing is, I don't think that my biomom was even *aware* that her food was that disgusting.  Whenever we went out for dinner (which was more often than what my father wanted, but *he* was the one that insisted on going) she did nothing but complain about how the food was undercooked, \"practically raw,\" or \"too spicy,\" to eat.  When she went to other people's houses (including her own extended family) she would criticize them for \"doing it wrong\" when she watched them cook anything.  She would often end up refusing to eat their food because she \"watched them ruin it,\" when they cooked it.  We never had guests over to eat her cooking.  Ever.",

When I was a kid, my friend's mom thought most food would \"cause autism.\" She also genuinely thought *all* sugar was bad for you, and FRUIT was forbidden in her house. (For the record, she was also extremely fatphobic.) She was also a terrible cook, and took it as a personal offense when I asked for some ketchup once. Condiments were a big nope. They made food enjoyable so therefore they were forbidden. This woman hated joy.\n\nAnyway, I had to spend the night at my friend's house once when my parents went on some trip. I was nervous about dinner, because I'd heard the stories. We had... roast... god knows what tbh. It was so dry I nearly choked. It was overcooked to the point of being like jerky. It had sharp edged and actually cut the inside of my mouth. We were only allowed to have water or milk with dinner, as juice would give us the autism and anything caffeinated was of the devil, according to friend's mom. After that dinner, I never ate there again. \n\nLong story short, my mom used to sneak real food to my friend through a wooden fence, and none of us \"caught autism\" from the canned fruit.

He invited me to dinner over at his one night, says his wife makes really amazing Italian food. I stopped off on the way to buy a bottle of wine and a nice cake for dessert because my parents always told me never to show up empty handed.\n\nWell. The second he opened the door, I was hit with a wave of odor that I can best describe as a collection of urines...human and animal. The house had the look of a shithole that was only recently 'cleaned' for company - like everything had a slight film of filth over it, piles of dust/dried cat shit in corners, etc. His wife was about 10 years older than him and kinda weirdly manic as she ran around cooking, yelling at the kids (a chunky teen who smelled like death and a demon 5-year old) and then throwing me random one-liners of small talk.\n\nMy coworker invited me down to the basement, which was surprisingly clean compared to the upstairs but was also obviously his office/studio space which had been taken over by a warehouse's worth of large plastic containers full of his wife's abandoned craft stuff. We went back upstairs and the teen was carrying the screaming child upstairs as she'd pissed all over herself and the floor. I 'got a text' then went out on the porch to 'return a call' and was driving home 5 minutes later because of the 'emergency'.\n\nMy coworker was transferred to another team a few months later, and several years ago I heard through the grapevine that his wife left him for some Scottish guy she met through some kind of old-soul conspiracy theory dating site.",
