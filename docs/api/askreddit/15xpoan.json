It was a fairly short mountain but had a huge vertical cliff at the top. My plan was to make it look like a hiking accident. Once i got up there i stood at the edge and cried and yelled. It was there, at my lowest point while on a mountain peak, that i found a reason to live and to love myself. I then stayed up there for a while thinking about what could become of my life and i laughed loudly and shouted. I then safely walked down the mountain trail feeling a thousand pounds lighter. Ever since then when my depression gets bad again i just remind myself of that day.",
