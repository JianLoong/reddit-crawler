Their characters are always compelling and their dialogue is heaps of fun. And I can’t help but be impressed by just how many stories they are able to regularly write.

I found your recent [PM] very impressive, so many stories!\n\nNow time for some fun questions, if you don't mind.\n\n1) Seeing as you've been here for a fair while, I wondered if the kind of prompts you find yourself responding to has shifted at all over the years? Or do you think you still like writing the same sort of thing?\n\n2) Do you have a particular favourite piece you think best encapsulates your writing?\n\n3) Which character of yours would you least like to have to go on holiday with?",
