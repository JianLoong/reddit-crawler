 "selftext": "So, I (23F) and my fiance (Jake 23M) (fake names for the sake of this post) knew each other in high school but started dating about a year after it ended. We now live together, and life is good. \n\nBack in high school, I was friends with Alex. Hindsight, she was very toxic and we weren't good people together. After high school ended, we drifted apart, and I ended up deleting her off social media because of her behavior. A bit of background about Alex, one thing she did a lot in high school was date around the friend group. Then, when the date didn't pan out, she used the guy's crush on her as a means of bullying the girls they dated after her. For example, an Alex and a guy Sam went on 2 or 3 dates, and it didn't work out. When Sam started dating Becca, Alex would make remarks like \"OH her took you to *ice cream place* he took me to *frozen yogurt* guess he is broke this week LOL\" Very teenage girl drama. \n\nWell, Alex and Jake went on one date in high school, as you could guess. I had honestly forgotten about it until I ran into her recently. I was making small talk about me and Jake's life, engagement and such, Alex started chucking saying \"well its a good thing he got over me, or it wouldn't be happening.\" I hadn't spoken to her in 4 years at this point, and it took me a moment to remember they went out. I just made a face and replied, \"That is a weird thing to bring up. Do you still think about high school dates that much?\"\n\nShe went a bit pale and started stuttering saying \"well he seemed serious at the time and people said he was upset after the date\" I just said \"yeah that was like 7 or 8 years ago get over yourself\". It was awkward, so I just left her there to continue my errands.\n\nJake got a text from a mutual friend with Alex saying I was a jerk for \"berating her in public\" and \"made her feel bad for a joke.\" Jake doesn't think I was wrong it was weird to bring up his brief high school crush to his fiance.",

Never EVER doubt that. You didn't do anything wrong. You grew up and matured, that's literally all that happened. Your ex-friend and ex-mutual friend clearly peeked in highschool and has refused to acknowledge it. I do recommend getting your side of the story out first before they do in case they try to rally any other friends or people you know and try to ruin your reputation. Control the narrative. Your bf is awesome and definitely a keeper. He won't tolerate any insults towards his girl, a real man. You found a good one, and hopefully, this relationship ends with a ring on your finger.üòâ",
