   "message": "That the best thing I'll ever get from my mom is mild tolerance and I need to stop trying to get more out of her.\n\nSure it sucks that she doesn't give a single shit about me, but I can't do anything about it because she sees nothing wrong with that. She thinks her only purpose in life was to get married and have kid(s), well she did that so her job was done the moment she pushed me out. No one ever said anything about raising that kid or showing the slightest bit of affection, she got married and had a kid and that's it, job done, she can do whatever she wants now.\n\nIt hurts to see other people have a relationship with their mother, but I've finally realized I can't have that because it isn't there for me to get. Like everyone else is out flying helicopters because they all have helicopters and I have van so I can't fly my own helicopter even if I wanted to. It sucks but that's what I've got and I can't change it.",
