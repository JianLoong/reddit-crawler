   "message": "In the 90s I worked (7 straight years I ain't doin the math on the hours) in live radio broadcasting. Hit radio. Niche genre but hit format. I spent 4 hours minimum 6 days a week manually loading CDs into cue players, hitting buttons to play them and pulling sliders on sound boards to segue from song to jingle to song. I was really, really fucking good at it. My segues were flawless. Never a milisecond of dead air. I could read a live weather forecast and current temperature in 17 seconds or less. I was that jerk DJ who talked through the intro of the song you were trying to record on your boom box. I really wanted to make it my career, I loved working this side of the music industry.\n\nBy 2002 most hit radio stations in all but the smallest markets were being sold to satellite conglomerates. Those that weren't had everything but the voice pre-loaded into a computer that did the segue for you. Radio is a sad, sad shell of what it used to be and I'm lucky I got out in '99 before everything started going south. There was an actual skill involved that required practice and refinement, and split-second live improv, that just can't be recaptured. It's useless skill that I wasted on an industry that collapsed in the '00s. At best, I can use my fly editing skills to make good video clips but even that's being automated to where hands-on skill isn't in demand.",

   "message": "Golf, since my cunt-of-a-stepmother is going to push my father to move to Florida the second she retires and the majority of her family is down there. \n\nSuffice to say, she's the devil incarnate. My dad had a small heart attack months ago and she, not jokingly, said to the paramedics, \"He can't die, I have no one to cook for me.\" Dad's in denial, saying she was joking.\n\nShe'll put him in a home as soon as it's convenient.\n\nShe has her sister where we currently live and that bitch will move to Florida eventually as well.\n\nMy friends are not athletic. I only play golf with him. They know my feelings on them moving (I live on my own) and it doesn't matter.\n\nAlso found out my brother is moving to Florida separately so I'm pretty fucking depressed. \n\nSo, yeah, golf.",
