Or not just a couple, perhaps a group of friends?  \nWhy not carefully approach them and offer to take a photo of BOTH/ALL of them?  \nA SINGLE MINUTE of your time can immortalize you in their memories of that particular photo, of that particular era...  \nAND, guys: Feel free take inspiration from whatever idols you want, but my strong suggestion: Aragorn, from Lord of the Rings.  \nBeing King is is BIRTHRIGHT, so he makes sure everyone knows, right? Also, there is a rather clear hiearchy whose lives matter - and whose don't.  \nAnd he is an Alpha - he licked that elf chick's ear as he whispered something about floods... and abused that blondie... right?  \nNO - Aragorn is literally the... actually nice guy! He is a true badass - and a humble one! He is not a warrior, he is a soldier.  \nTRUST ME, you CAN step up as well! I think my first time was when I noticed, as I was walking through the public spaces, some woman beign physically harrased.  \nTL;DL: I played it perfectly - protected her, avoided escalation; the guy left. I asked her if she wants me to call the police (no - okay, no), offered her to stay with her until her friend arrived and she accepted. (\\*)  \nIt is something I can be genuinely proud of, and nothing will take that from me.  \n(funnily enough, )  \n(\\*) And even here, I tried to slip and additional effortless act of kindness - perhaps even out of boredom...? I asked her her for permission to ask her her country of origin. (no, nobody growing up here would use the language the way she did)  \nAs we were waiting, I mentioned how cool it is that she is from there, and talked about just \"immigrant stuff\" - because I once was an immigrant as well (both of us basically \"I want to give living there a try for a while, sounds fun not because of the jouyney, but also how faster the retirement fund will be growing THERE\").",
