   "message": "I have a lot of anxiety about most things, but test anxiety has never really been an issue for me.  It's not that I don't feel any, it's just that once it's go time, it's *go time* and in that moment it no longer matters.\n\nWhich was pretty useful when I took my state licensing exam for my job and the proctors from the testing company were freaking out while examining the materials I'd brought about how I'd followed my instructor's advice *not* to bring the \"book.\"  Just brought some forms and charts that were allowed.  The exam is 4 hours long and has a somewhat high failure rate.  \n\nPassed the test with about the same score as I'd achieved as a grade in the class, which the instructor said we could expect if we left the book at home.  Said those who *do* bring it tend to second guess themselves too much and waste time and end up ultimately scoring lower.  I figured that sounded like something I'd do, so chose to follow her advice.  I'd chosen that course among all my options even though it wasn't exactly the cheapest (though also not the most expensive) because they consistently have the highest pass rate as published on the state website, so figured their advice was probably sound.\n\nTo the proctors' credit, they were at least as enthusiastic about congratulating me on the good passing score as they had been about insisting I was making a horrible mistake.  My husband who had dropped me off and heard the initial exchange when I signed in (correctly) pointed out after he picked me up that a lot of people would have been *really* rattled by that kind of talk from the proctors and he thought they were assholes for pulling that kind of thing on people taking these big exams.",
