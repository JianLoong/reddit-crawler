And two equally fascinating villainesses as foils: a terrifying and hilarious Soviet agent and a 'secretly' brilliant scientist/movie star with a mobbed up ex-boyfriend, she's like half Hedy Lamarr and half Lana Turner, if they had embraced their justified rage and become supervillains. This show deserved more time. Edit: Forgot to mention there's a lot of good stuff with Howard Stark and his butler, the original, human Jarvis. Chad Michael Murray is a main character and does great work. Peggy's love interests are a black scientist and a fellow agent who was disabled in the war. Another agent actually tells him \"I get it, but no woman is exchanging a red, white and blue shield for a metal crutch\" He deals with a lot of ableism from other guys despite being in amazing shape (he's played by Enver Gjokaj) and you know...injured in the war they all fought in!
