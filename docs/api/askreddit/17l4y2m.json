   "message": "Long-haul truck driver.\n\n(Semi-retired now.) I'm proud of my 30y career. The last 10 years I was OTR. What a blast! I've had a damn lot of fun, so many adventures on and off the road. And a handful of horrors too. I've seen so many interesting factories, everything that goes into making our modern world. I've seen both oceans and the gulf, and every mountain range. It was a big deal to make all 48 continental states. I'm female (52) and keenly aware that earlier in history I wouldn't have been let to do a job like this. (No, my ex-husband was not a driver at all. Before trucking I owned an independent cab then started driving vans and little trucks and kept moving up for 19 more years.)",
