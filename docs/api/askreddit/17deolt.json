   "message": "A good bath tub.\n\nIf you're building a house or remodeling your bathroom, pay the extra money and get a decent tub from a manufacturer, not a place like Home Depot or Lowes or Menards etc.\n\nThis is for acrylic/composite/fiber glass units, not steel/cast iron, but they also vary in quality and should be treated as I'm about to explain.\n\n$900 is a lot of money, but it's cheap as shit for a tub. $1100 is a lot of money...still considered cheap for a tub.\n\nNo one should have to break the bank on a bath tub (or shower stall), regardless if you want a soaking tub or just a vessel for which you clean yourself in. At the same time, money means better quality. Anything made of polystyrene in HD or Lowe's looks really nice, but breaks extremely easily and it's super hard to fix bc no matter how much you sand it, there's just never enough adhesive and virtually everything from lacquer thinner to rubbing alcohol can mar the surface and take away its luster.\n\nOne manufacturer that I work for has a few base models that are just such cheap shit and I'm constantly doing warranty work for them. However, usually it's in a really nice home and I find myself questioning why these people have a $3500 refrigerator and an $1100 tub that's nothing more than cheap acrylic and some fiberglass backing. Then when it breaks, they're super shocked that it was made with such low quality. But when you open the brochure on the line of tubs, this model I constantly see is their cheapest unit! SPEND THE MONEY, GET THE HIGHER QUALITY!!\n\nFiberglass is even worse. It's made with the very bare minimum materials. Sometimes, as I'm fixing a brand new unit, I notice black speckles on the wall bc they only did one coat of gelcoat. Can't even fix that! You paint it, and then sand it and buff it and it doesn't come back. It's shit! Spend the money! Get the higher quality!\n\nUltimately, the thing is screwed into the studs of your home. It becomes a part of the actual house, and then sometimes it gets tiled in on top of that. You do *not* want to have to replace the unit, meaning pulling the tiles or the shower panels bc you got the cheapest of the line, but then you're also facing a repair into your brand new unit. Sometimes, before you even got to use it yourself...\n\n99% of my work is new construction. I fix acrylic and fiberglass bath tubs and shower receptors. Even if I had to open a credit card just for the tub, after what I've seen in these homes, it'd be well worth it to have a solid unit for the next 20 years instead of 3...",
