Facebook also allowed illegal selling of OxyContin, which Zuckerberg knew about and enabled it despite crisis. They already got multiple fines in Europe for breaking privacy laws, so they are doing a lot to become a subject not falling under European laws. Also because Treads are literally a treat to privacy, they are not available in Europe. \n\nThis might seem like something very far away from us, but they use every single person for their profit.
