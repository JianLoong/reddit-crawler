Because if it were good, it would be absorbed by other cultures. It maintains faithful to its cultural roots by being evil.\n\nThe younger generation despises it and doesn't know why anyone would ever eat it.\n\n\n\nDespite continuing to dislike it, the middle generation continues to partake out of respect for tradition.\n\n\n\nThe older generation enjoys it and takes great pleasure in instructing the younger generation on the history and significance of the cuisine.",
