   "message": "Crumbl Cookies cream cheese red velvet cookie\n\nBefore I get started I should clarify that I have an allergy to Red 40, which is the food dye they use in just about anything that’s red. It’s hard to avoid it so typically I run into it every once in a while which is fine, I don’t get super sick unless I consume great amounts of it. \n\nFast forward to June 24th, it’s 10:30 pm, I’ve just come home from a 10 hour shift. I’m exhausted and hungry since I didn’t get a break from how busy the store had been. On the dining room table is a box of crumbl cookies, with all the lights off it was hard to see the cookies so I pick one up take and bite and realize it’s cream cheese Oreo. After a few episodes of shameless I finish the cookie and go to bed. After an hour tossing and turning I went downstairs to smoke some grass to help me fall asleep. At this point my stomach is turning inside and out but as soon as I hit my bed I’m out cold. 2 hours later at 4 in the morning I wake up feeling like shit, my stomach hurting more than ever and my whole body sweating and as soon as I sit up comes what feels like satan himself crawling up my throat and flooding my mouth. Disoriented and tired I rush for the bathroom but before I can even get a foot off the bed, vomit comes erupting outward all over my carpet, littering my belongings with putrid smelling red goop. This continued for 20 minutes until I had nothing left to exit my body leading to dry heaving. Another 2 hours of drinking water and throwing it back up into the toilet I finally passed out in the bathroom and woke up the next day at 10 am. I can’t even begin to describe the horrid stench I could smell coming from my room. After cleaning everything up I spent the next four days shivering in bed with hives, nausea, fever, and body aches. Easily the sickest I’ve been in my entire life. At this point I had no idea what had made me so sick until I checked crumbls cookies of the week and realized that the Oreo cookie I had eaten was actually cream cheese red velvet. \n\nOver a month later, I swear to it that I can still taste the red dye crumbl death cookie and it makes me gag. Although, if I could eat it without it affecting my allergies, I would devour thousands of cookies to get back at that evil cookie.",
