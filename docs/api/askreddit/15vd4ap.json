I distinctly remember when the norm became to get a Netflix account for $7.99 and then just resort to pirating anything that isn't on there, which usually ended up not being too much, although one of the popular ones was Game of Thrones.\n\nAt this point piracy is back up not only because of streaming service prices or even fragmentation of content, but convenience is a huge factor. Most people are okay with checking for their desired content on one or two, maybe three services tops? However now there's so many services, content keeps switching hands, and even the actual services aren't consistent between regions. The Office (US) leaving Netflix in the US was a huge deal, yet Netflix Canada still has it with no issues. Don't forget now you even have weird situations such as Disney delisting their own content on their own streaming service, such as Carter.\n\nAlthough the big difference with piracy now? VPN knowledge is a mainstream thing these days compared to 10-15 years ago, so there is hardly a reason these days to not use a VPN if you're going to sail the seas.",

   "message": "chef celebrity. \n\nMaybe it will come back again, but the food network went the way of the history channel with gimmicky ideas and most of the big names are not providing the educational programming that made food shows nice. Instead it is \"can Gordon Ramsay cook scrambled eggs over an open fire in a ranch in Texas\", I would even say that when top chef does a remote camping challenge they judge the food and not the art of cooking for camping (judging by camping friendly foods that accommodate weight, lack of sent to deter animals, minimal environmental impact). Moreover the big celebrity chef channels are feeding off each other so Jamie Oliver has 20 lesser names he is basically platforming for regional specialties on YouTube. Even Babish seems sort of out of recipes and trying to find ways to stay evergreen. Bobby Flay seems to have pivoted to more restaurant business expose/non fiction.",
