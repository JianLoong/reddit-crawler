They went to bed and I slept on the couch but at some point rolled onto the floor. When I woke up in the morning I smelled coffee and looked over to see my roommates gf in a tank top and panties. \n\nIt gets worse. \n\nIt was a split second later my body remembered my back is made of jello and moldy bread and I couldn’t move that much so I attempted to crawl on the couch. The gf knows of my marshmallow spine and immediately comes over and helps me to the couch and sits down next to me and goes “DONT WORRY MY MOM IS A MASSEUSE AND MY DAD IS A CHIROPRACTOR. ILL FIX IT.”\n\nI got a massage from a half naked woman who was just out here doing the lords work while I couldn’t move for multiple reasons. Best part. Roommate walked out of the bedroom and didn’t even question it. Just went “is OPs back fucked up again?”",

I can still picture the look on her face and I swear she wanted me to invite her up to my room.\n\nMaybe it was all in my head and my ego was inflated with alcohol but I don't think so.

It was super early in the morning and the only person around was the cop/EMT on duty who was rolling by in his squad SUV. Nice fellow, a good twenty years older than me (F late twenties at the time), had known each other for a good five years through the fire department (my significant other is a full time firefighter).\n\nI definitely considered this man a good friend, and never anything but a platonic one. He’s married, I am happily in a long term relationship with a wonderful man. It’s a small town, so we interacted frequently.\n\nHe stopped and came over with his medic bag to check on me. I’d gotten up and was on a street bench trying to stop the bleeding and he came over and we talked for a few seconds and he asked if he could check my hand out, so I let him take my hand in his.\n\nI suppose we’d never had any physical contact before this, aside from a brief handshake the first time we met, but when he took my hand it was like the most insane current of electricity ran through me and I got hot and tingly all over. I know he felt it too. We stared at each other for a few seconds and he turned bright red and sort of fumbled and muttered his way through disinfecting and wrapping up my hand. He was wearing weather-appropriate footwear and so he helped me to the door of my work and gave me some care instructions for the hand and left. He kindly came back a half hour later and salted the sidewalk in front of my building, but we just waved awkwardly from either sides of the window.\n\nWe never mentioned it again. We remain friends, but it was pretty awkward for a while after. It’s been a few years and we are still very careful to never cross any boundaries and we definitely, *definitely* avoid physical contact.\n\nIt is the #1 most erotic and non sexual event of my entire life. Never felt anything like it before or since.",

   "message": "Idk if this counts because it involves a kiss but it wasn't sex and I think about it often.\n\nThere was a guy I had been talking to platonically for a few months online after we met through a mutual friend. He seemed like the perfect guy and I enjoyed talking to him. Our mutual friend had a party and he was there. I think I went to get a beer out of the kitchen and he followed me and just kissed me out of the blue, without saying a word. It was exciting and surprising and probably the best kiss of my life because of that. I still melt thinking about it.",

   "message": "I visited my wifes family (she was just my gf at the time) in Switzerland and as an American I'm not used to the cheek to cheek kissy thing that many people around the world do when they greet each other. \n\nOne of her relatives is a beautiful blonde Swiss girl in her early 20s and was kinda shy. We met up with her and her family at a park and upon our arrival she greets us with the cheek kissy thing and I was still learning that you don't actually kiss the persons cheek but just touch cheek to cheek and make the kissy sound. Maybe I got too comfortable because it was a pretty girl but without thinking my initial instinct was to actually kiss the cheek the way I'd kiss my girlfriends cheek. When I pulled back I saw she was blushing a lot and had a kinda nervous smile on her and I realized that I did the wrong kissy thing. Luckily I dont think anyone else noticed. Not super sexual but there was definitely some tension after that.",

On the walk back to my apartment I end up waiting for the crosswalk light to change next to this beautiful woman my age-ish. I notice she also had a Ralphs bag with a bag of doritos in it. She'd just done the same thing I did. We shared a few quips and smiles back and fourth, but the light hadn't changed yet and suddenly she went \"oh\" and started booking it across the street after she realized there was an opening. By the time I realized that there was an opening, traffic had picked up again and I couldn't go. She turned and shouted back \"you should have came!\" and I said \"I should've!\" I think about that moment at least once a month every year of my life. That happened when I first moved to LA 15 years ago. That was some soul mate movie shit if I've ever had it.",

   "message": "I was helping a girl study in college. It was some basic calculus related rates of change stuff. She had the problem on her laptop in her lap. I was sitting next to her on the dorm commons couch. We were knocking out problems but I kept having to reach over her lap to use the touchpad while pointing out stuff on the screen. I was borrowing one of her pens to write and stuck it between my teeth to flip to a page in her textbook. She said “I’ve had that in my mouth” to let me know she also chewed on the pen. I instinctively said “eh, it’s no different from kissing you” and carried on.\n\nNow, maybe that’s a good line. Maybe it isn’t. But I had heard that line somewhere in the context of a dog taking a bite off a sandwich and someone saying “it’s the same as kissing the dog” while continuing to eat the sandwich with the dog licking their face. It was completely innocent and said mostly as a joke. \n\nShe stared at me for the next 10-15 seconds with the tip of her other pen at the edge of her mouth. I realized the reaction and pivoted back to the calculus. She slid her laptop closer to her so the touchpad was nearly against her stomach. We finished the work, but the last few problems were a bit more intimate. \n\nShe aced her test and brought me dinner in the dorms. We studied together for a few more classes with similar tension. I had a girlfriend at the time, so there was no shot for me. I didn’t realize until a semester later that she didn’t know I had a girlfriend, and I felt horrible. She didn’t talk to me for a few weeks when she found out. I thought she knew the whole time.",

I said \"I know I have daddy issues but I don't have THAT kind of daddy issues!\" Little did I know I have THAT kind of daddy issues, and he's got baby girl issues.

I showed up and she was there. We were hanging outside of the club waiting for someone. It was fall time and kind of cold outside. She was wearing basically a skirt and short sleeve attire. She was shivering a little. Totally out of character for me, but without hesitation I wrapped one arm around her and pulled her to close to me to warm her up. Mind you, we barely knew each other. She turned and looked at me with the hottest sex eyes I’ve ever been given, and I could tell she was flustered because of how she sounded when thanking me. We spent most of the night on the dance floor with her and her friend grinding with me. Never saw her again after that outside of work.\n\nEdit for spelling",

   "message": "I have 2\n\n1.  My very attractive, very well endowed female friend got undressed in front of me. We were hanging out and she was still in work clothes, so she just stripped and then changed into regular clothes. Bra and underwear stayed on, but I was very confused for a very long time as to why she did that. I remember saying “um…” and she just said “whatever.”\n\n2. My buddy and I went to a concert that was 2 hours from our house. The line to leave the venue was impossibly long. We sat in our car for probably 45 minutes before we even started to move. At this point we were tired and didn’t think either of us should drive this late to get home, so he called a friend of his who lived in the area and asked if we could crash for the night. She said of course. Now she had a studio apartment, and there was literally nowhere on the ground for us to sleep and stretch out comfortably. She had one of those wooden loft things where there was a mattress on top and a desk underneath to save space. The mattress was a double but if we all squeezed in a bit we could fit. I should mention she was smoking hot and this felt awkward but I wasn’t going to complain. We slept head to toe, with her in the middle. And she slept in her underwear and a t-shirt. All night I kept waking up to her barely covered ass right on my face. I was ok with it. I guess my friend was falling off the bed (I was against the wall) so at some point grabbed a blanket and curled up on a bean bag chair. When we wake up, I have the most OBVIOUS morning wood. I’m just laying there hoping it goes away before she wakes up. But then dread enters my soul when I hear her say.  “Good morning… I guess you’re happy to see me.”  Mortifying, but she laughed. “It’s ok, it happens. It’s natural.” And then before she hopped out of bed to go get ready for the day, she called back “sorry I can’t take care of that for you, but I gotta go to class” My friend slept through the whole interaction and didn’t believe me. But that was Fap material for like a year.",

In college I was in counseling and we started breaking down my sexual abuse. And I’m also a woman at a conservative Christian college. I started understanding my body. And it started when I was hugging people on campus. I loved hugs and would hug anyone. Well, when you’re 5’4 and you hug a fit 6’4 attractive man you rest on his chest. I remember hugging this guy was electric. I felt so bad because people taught you to go against your urges but I really enjoyed hugging him. I did it often. And we’re both married now and happy but I still remember it as my first time understanding I was experiencing sexual arousal.\n\nThere were a few more incidences, me very awkwardly getting through college. Once, I had a huge crush on a friend of mine and I went to his room during “open house” where girls can visit guys rooms and other way around. And he sang a song he wrote and was performing Saturday. And seeing his vulnerability I became so wet. I had to adjust my self and excuse myself soon, not forgetting my hug though, haha, and had to clean up. \n\nIm getting better but still have times im a mess when it comes to sexual stuff.
