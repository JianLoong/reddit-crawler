 "title": "AITAH for being mad that my boyfriend's ex wife ruined my birthday plans?",
 "selftext": "I'm a 38 year old female. Been with my boyfriend for 4 years now. His ex has always been an issue but we deal with it. He has a 14 year old son. I don't have much of a relationship with him because his mom doesn't like the fact that his dad moved on after the divorce and she hasn't. She was caught cheating BTW and the man she cheated with went back to his wife. So, she is bitter towards us. Now, my boyfriend and I have been making plans for my birthday. We planned a day together,  going on a short road trip and then dinner. My boyfriend already told his ex that he would be out of town that day if their son needed anything. Everything was fine up until  that morning.  He gets a call that his son's mother has decided to go out of town and she was dropping their son off. I asked him to inform her that we had plans as discussed previous and she needs to adhere to the plans. It was her weekend to have him anyway.  My boyfriend refused . Any other time, I tell him his kids come first but this was my day. My one day out of the year that I ask to be accommodated. I never ask for anything during the holidays, this is just MY day.  His son gets bored easily and is constantly complaining so the entire day will be miserable with him constantly wanting to go home.  My boyfriend asked if we could reschedule. I told him NO!!  This is the one time I ask him to do for me and he can't. I told him to have a great day with his son, I was going to celebrate by myself.  He got mad and said I was not being fair. I explained to him that it isn't fair for him to coward down to his ex wife and stick the plans. She KNEW we were going out of town. So I left and did my own thing by myself.  AITAH for celebrating my birthday without him?",

No that was the most reasonable thing you could have done under those circumstances.   \n\n\nCalling him a coward was kind of an asshole thing to do though. Because at the end of the day lets say he told his ex that he told her already he had plans sorry and ex just leaves the kid at home alone or out in front of his house, what are his options? Ignore the kid and risk them doing something stupid unsupervised or canceling mid plans to pick up kid anyways. If this is a frequent issue he should probably be pushing for sole custody on the grounds that the mother is showing that she's unfit by being unavailable during the periods when she has custody but even if he did that you still have the issue of him having the kid and either the kid having to be included in your you time or otherwise occupying his time.   \n\n\nAt the end of the day you're a grown ass woman and his kid will always be his responsibility both morally and legally at least until the kid is grown and that means the kid has to be his priority so you don't get to pick a day for him to choose you over the kid.

If she's a horrible person and unattractive, it's less likely she will find someone to distract her from you two, so she will make your lives miserable as long as she can. I understand the father, but he needs to also understand that he cannot let himself be manipulated. His son is no longer a baby and he could have stood his ground and let her know she could take him where she was going, that he had plans. Rent a hotel room if it was a job interview or whatever and park her son's 14 yr old behind there for a while. Like others said, you are going to have to keep your info to yourself instead of trying to be reasonable, because she won't be. I wouldn't say this is breakup worthy, but he does need to be less emotional and know that if he's trying to set up a new life with you, your feelings also matter. I find that most divorced parents usually do things for their kids out of guilt. He needs to work on that if that's his case.",
