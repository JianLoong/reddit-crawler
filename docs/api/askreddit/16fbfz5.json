How \"he's not like those guys\" but that's how the world works and \"304's\" are anomalies and commented on the way these women wear revealing clothes (cue me looking down at my skirt). After my initial shock, I challenged him. Then realizing this wasn't working, I disagreed and politely asked to change the topic. He wouldn't let it go.\n\nHe not only continued, but OVER AN HOUR about the \"biology\" of women and men, and then had a bunch of religious \"wisdom\" in there for me that I just can't remember. Looking back I totally could've gotten an uber home, but at the time he was my ride so I just politely smiled and nodded.\n\nThe next morning I texted him we had different world views it wasn't going to work.
