They have no concept of food safety, can barely be bothered to do more than moisten their hands in the bathroom, if that, and will happily send their little impulse driven germ riddled spawn up to feed themselves without supervision.\n\nLiterally seen a kid's hand go from up his nose, into his mouth, and then into a pan full of fried shrimp to dump a fistful onto a filthy plate he'd already reused  for 3-4 trips to the bar. \n\nYes, there were tongs in the pan and he ignored them. No, using a napkin to grab the utensils isn't going to make you any safer from other people's bad habits.\n\nYes, we removed the pan and replaced it, but we couldn't watch every pan all the time.\n\nDon't eat at buffets.",
