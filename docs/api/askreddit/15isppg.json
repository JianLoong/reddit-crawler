My mom is a light sleeper so if I stepped anywhere that made the wooden floor creak she'd yell \"who's awake?!\". Well, during the day I would memorize all the creaking spots from my room to the living room (where the chocolates were at). I wouldn't get greedy though (only 2 or 3 chocolates at a time). I was super patient. If I heard any noise that made me suspect someone was awake, I would stand there frozen for nearly 10 minutes at a time. \n\nI even had a plan B in case someone had to use the bathroom (hiding spots). One night my dad got up to pee and I hid behind the china cabinet while he walked past me half asleep.",

You had to walk a long way through carpet to get to the door, so your shoes would surely be mostly clean by that point, and\n2. Anyone could just simply take it.\n\nI kinda just assumed someone would steal it eventually, but after about a month, I noticed it was still there. I obviously wasn't going to steal someone's stuff, but I did want to mess with it, so I simply moved it to the door across the hall. The next day, I saw it had been moved back, so I decided to move it across the hall again. I did this for an entire year. Sometimes they'd give up and leave it at the other door for a week, then I'd just move it back to fuck with them. I loved the idea that it surely led to some sort of argument between the two neighbors because nobody is gonna think some guy is just randomly deciding to fuck with them for no reason. I literally never met either of the people that lived in those rooms. I just kept messing with their mat. \n\nI had some special moments with it too. On Christmas, I replaced the mat with a Christmas one and then put the original one back the next day. On Easter, I bought the cheapest, shittiest Easter basket I could find and filled it with granny candies like Werthers and those strawberry candies, then I \"hid\" it under the mat. At one point, I bought a second mat to just sometimes put at both doors, then take the second mat away randomly. Eventually I moved into an apartment and couldn't mess with them anymore though. They never got to find out wtf was going on.",

   "message": "I've had type 1 diabetes since I was 3. On my 9th birthday, my grandma made a birthday cake for me, which was big enough for us all to share at the family party. Since there was so much food, we had plenty of leftover cake for the next few days, which I was only allowed to eat a little bit of. \n\nWhen no one was around, I snuck into the kitchen and ate a couple slices of the leftover cake, plus I picked huge chunks of the icing off. It looked pretty haphazard by the time I snuck away again. \n\nMy parents soon found the remains of the cake. Since I'm diabetic, they didn't suspect that it was me who picked at the leftovers (I was usually a very well-behaved kid). They blamed it on our rather chubby cat, and promptly deemed it unacceptable for human consumption. It was a believable scenario because she had stolen human food in the past. Sadly, they threw the rest of the cake out.\n\nI could never own up to it because I would have been in trouble for compromising my blood sugar levels, and for being greedy! My old cat never ratted me out for letting her take the blame, though. Thanks, Molly, R.I.P!",

I must not have heard our coach when he told us that practice would be cancelled the next day because of a personal scheduling conflict. One other kid and I showed up to find an empty gym with all the lights out. We spent the hour using a turned over garbage can and the increasing sunlight from the skylights to try to dunk a kid's mini basketball on the 10-foot rim. I was tall for my age but still couldn't do it. We never told anyone.",
