On July 4th, 2000 I was at Venice Beach in Florida when I hit my head against a pier with a nail sticking out. The nail grabbed my scalp and pulled it back, effectively almost scalping me. Being a head wound, blood loss was insane, and I was afraid that I was going to die (I was just 13 at the time, so it was even more terrifying). To this day, I can still feel the scar. I would love to find somebody that was there that day (not in my family) to get their account of how it went down. I have mine and a few family members' accounts, but, a stranger's account would be really interesting to hear. Maybe I should make a post just for that?\r  \n\r  \nHere is a photo of my head 2 weeks after the accident.
