 "selftext": "This was the scene in Rosanna Rd (near Burgundy St) Sunday morning.  I have no idea the outcome as nothing seems to have been in the news.  Considering the power pole is all the way into the engine bay which means the engine isn't there it couldn't have ended that well.  Anyone know anything?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n37o2quajyhb1.png?width=671\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=a7d18e828e27981f9b13e86242c4dfdd0cb7ca9c",
