 "selftext": "My cousin (14F) just started high school, and I (19F) take her to school in the mornings because I haven't started college classes yet. Lately, when I pick her up she's been hugging and kissing this really tall and mature guy, and when I asked her about it she said it was her boyfriend. I didn't think much of it because I assumed he was a sophomore or something.\n\nOne day, she asked me if I could drive him home and I said I could, and when I picked them up, I asked him for his age on the way to his house. He proudly told me he was 18, and I asked what grade he was in. He is a senior, and when I dropped him off I immediately told her to break up with him because that's just crazy that they're kissing and dating. Who knows what they've done already?\n\nShe got all pissed at me for opening my mouth and told me that he's the love of her life, and no matter what they'll be together. After that, I said she can walk herself to school and back home because I would rather not see them smacking lips at the end of the day. She immediately threw a tantrum saying there was nothing weird about it and I was just being a bitch.\n\nAITAH here??",
