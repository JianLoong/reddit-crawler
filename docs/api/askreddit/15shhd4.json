He linked it to a bad diet, specifically a corn heavy diet.\n\nCornmeal and grits were a southern staple, and and incredibly cheap way to feed orphans, prisoners, and the poor.  Pellagra is caused by a lack of vitamin B3, aka niacin.  Normally corn is high in niacin, but that niacin is locked up and unavailable to the human digestive system unless the corn is treated, aka \"softened\", typically with lye.\n\nIn the early 1900's, manufactures switched to a different process that eliminated this treatment with lye.  Corn was no longer softened.\n\nThen people, especially the poor, prisoners and orphans started dying of pellagra.  Some orphanages and prisons had a death rate of over 40%.  Tens of thousands were dying annually.\n\nThrough a series of experiments, Goldberger proved that it was a corn-heavy diet that caused pellagra.  He cured it in 2 institutions just by adding vegetables to their diet.  He also caused it in a 14 prisoner \"volunteers\".\n\nBut, and this is the important part:\n\nHe was Jewish, and he was trying to tell Southerners they they were doing something wrong.\n\nSo he was ridiculed and ignored.\n\nAnd pellagra continued to kill tens of thousands in the USA, and sicken tens of thousands more, for decades.\n\nWhen Goldberger died in 1929 pellagra continued to kill tens of thousands annually, 15 years after he had found the cure.  It would continue to kill thousands for another couple of decades until someone more acceptable, Conrad Elvehjem, confirmed Goldberger's work in the late 1930's.\n\nAll because southerners didn't want a Jew telling then that they were doing something wrong.  He was insulting their southern heritage, by god!\n\nPS: \"Insulting their southern heritage\" is not my words.  It's the words of the southern politicians who pulled his funding and campaigned for his removal from the US Public Health Service.",
