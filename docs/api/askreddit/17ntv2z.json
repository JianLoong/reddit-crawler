The heart wants what it wants. We dated for a year and half (2years since meeting) and I actually got to see her at her worst a few times, but i was finally able to get her therapy with a great psychiatrist and treatment, this is when I asked her to move in with me.\n\n We've been now living together for six years, four years ago she had the worst breakdown I've seen. She went full on paranoid, wall scratching nervous, she was even doubting me and my motives to be there. It was a very difficult week, she left the house and went to her moms house in the middle of the night and eventually her therapist was able to get a hold of her and get her back to her senses. Dr then suggested that I also should go to a counselor or at the very least we should do couples therapy so we had strong bases for our relationship and we did. \n\nI now look back and won't change her for anything in the world, she has grown so much, she glows right now. I now see her smile and it's glorious. She's achieve a great position too and it's amazing just to see how much happier she looks.",

It‚Äôs usually not a conscious thought process. \n\nShe‚Äôs married again, and I‚Äôm finally happy so I guess it went well.
