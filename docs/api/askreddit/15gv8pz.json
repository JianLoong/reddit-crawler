Got out of the small home town and saw new cultures, met new people (got to talk to an actual Afghan refugee once, which was cool), and really learned some basic fucking empathy. It‚Äôs a very condensed version of a very long story. But I‚Äôve done pretty much a 180 on political views at this point, fortunately (except guns - still love me guns). But dear god do I cringe at what I used to be. I genuinely hate my past self, for it was nothing but hatred and fear of others.\n\nEdit - Thank y‚Äôall for the kind words - this got more attention than I thought or intended. It‚Äôs admittedly easier to talk about on the internet where I ain‚Äôt got a face. The process took years to get past the so deeply ingrained hate that I held, and it was legitimately a struggle.",

   "message": "The heartbreak and wanting any sort of female attention/love thirsty phase between 2015 to about 2018. During this period, i was desperate for any sort of attention from women.. whether it be good or bad (i preferred good lmao) and as a result I was labeled a thirsty dude.\n\n It hurt but i understood why this came to be but heres the thing: I was in pain after a breakup with someone i cared about and I wanted that pain to go away sooner than later so i would try to talk to women i met hoping that they would be interested in me but for the most part they weren't and that was ok. It took a lot of healing from that break up and then some and some therapy many years later to realize that i had anxious attachment issues(years of trauma) and that break up was the catalyst for doing what i did. Im still not completely healed yet but im better than how i was back then and I try not to put women on a pedestal anymore but its hard to do so sometimes..welp",
