 "selftext": "I (20F) went on a good few dates with a guy (25M). Everything was going well, and they guy was really nice at first. \nAfter a couple dates I asked him if he had any children as I saw a tattoo with a child‚Äôs name on it. \nI asked him if it was his child and he told me it was his nephew and I thought it was cute he had the child‚Äôs name tattooed. \n\nAfter a few more dates, I started to question a few things, why the child‚Äôs name had his last name and not the fathers, why there‚Äôs was a car seat in his car for a child and how he couldn‚Äôt do anything on the weekends. \nAfter my suspicions, I asked him again and he told me that he previously lied and that it was his child, and that he didn‚Äôt want to tell me. \nI don‚Äôt mind if someone has a child, it means there is more people to love. But I couldn‚Äôt carry on because he lied about it being his nephew. \n\nSo Reddit AITAH?\n\nEdit: I have had a few comments about how I know it was a child‚Äôs name‚Ä¶ at first everytime we went out and whenever he would come over, he was wearing long sleeved tees, hoodies, jackets wtc so I never saw it‚Ä¶ when it was summer time ge started wearing t-shirts and that‚Äôs when I saw the tattoo‚Ä¶ I asked thinking it was a grandparent, parent, lost love one, pet, maybe even this ‚Äúnephew‚Äù he lied about‚Ä¶. He told me it was his nephews name, and with me saying it had the same last name I also asked about that and he said ‚Äúmy nephew has his dads last name‚Ä¶ I just got it for him with the family name‚Äù which I thought was cute - just to clarify that \n\nAlso, I never said that there was a problem with him having a child, again I didn‚Äôt mind him having a child‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not the issue, the issue was we were dating/ talking \u0026amp; getting closer for a while‚Ä¶ and he still continued to tell me it was his nephew abs when he finally did I told him I knew and that he shouldn‚Äôt of lied to me \u0026amp; that I don‚Äôt think I can carry on talking to him as he lied.\n\nLastly, I am 20 and I do want my own children someday‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt mean I wasn‚Äôt accepting of his child, so lastly, we were talking about children and he told me he didn‚Äôt want any‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when I started to pull away a bit, but he told me he didn‚Äôt want any, lied about his child being his nephew and then told me he never wanted any, when he already had a child he didn‚Äôt tell me about. \n\nEdit 2: another comment I‚Äôve been getting a couple times is saying how they wouldn‚Äôt say on the first few dates but we had been going on dates/ getting close to being in a relationship‚Ä¶ this was going on for about 8-9 months and I had asked him loads as things were not adding up, also the fact he said his mum wanted to meet me but he didn‚Äôt want me to - maybe because he thought I would find out, so I would if understood if it was the first few days but 8-9 months when you‚Äôre about to get into a relationship is not something that I can take lightly, I hope people understand. \n\nHope the update helps.

Worse, he was mad he had to pay child support and that OP had more \"fun money,\" so his brilliant idea was to sue for 50% child custody so no more child support. Oh, and he forgot to mention, he works 16-hour days, so he expected OP to be the one picking up the childcare for him.\n\nOP was the badass I wish I had been in my first marriage: She owns her own business, had a prenup, and inherited her house. She got to keep everything, and Mr. \"you have more fun money than me it's not fair, wah\" was told she wanted a divorce. Now of course he's kicking up a fuss calling her selfish...\n\nSo, yeah. If he had said, \"Yes, I have a child, but I'm not comfortable introducing him to anyone unless we're serious,\" that would be one thing. But to lie about something so easily explainable as well as disproven? That's a no from me, hon. A healthy relationship is built on trust! You guys are in what I call the \"honeymoon phase\" of the relationship, the \"I need to make a good impression\" stage (so this is likely where he'll be more encouraged to be on his best behavior). And he's already lying about BIG things? Things that would impact your lives together if you were to become a couple?\n\nPart of me gets it; you do have to be careful what information you put out there. But on a *dating app,* something where you're asking people to come join your actual life and they'll see up close and personal for themselves?

They lied or omitted because they knew dating an individual and dating a parent are two completely different scenarios.\n\nFrankly a willingness to lie or omit that you have kids in your life is a redflag for more than one reason. Like, if you wound up with this dude more seriously you'd probably find he's a shit father because he'd prioritize dating and inveigling someone in his life over acknowledging his kids as an important part of his life. You'd either find yourself in an unhealthy situation with kids who aren't too hot on you and watching their father mistreat them for it, or be expected to step in as a parent for an inattentive one.",
