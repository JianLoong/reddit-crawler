It can bring out the worst aspects of personality/behavior even in those without a personality disorder. I briefly tried out modeling the summer before I went to college, and I found it very difficult to meet others in the industry who didn’t show considerable signs of cluster B personality disorders. Even if someone was considerably “nice,” there was just so much obsession with physical appearance, and so their entire lifestyle revolved around maintaining and/or showing off their physical self. Makeup and fashion and diet/exercise isn’t just a hobby to them, it’s all they seem to focus on. Suffice to say, I did not continue beyond a couple photoshoots. I knew even my own mental health would not last long in that industry, and I’d be pressed to anybody who wouldn’t fall victim to the unhealthy mindset that develops in the industry. I’m much happier, and subsequently, much less f’ed up than what would’ve been since pursuing a passion that involves cognitive performance over physical appearance.",

It turned out he was always hurting himself (quite badly sometimes) for attention? Or maybe to not have to work? I'll never know. He did this prior to working in a funeral home and after. It became apparent because it started escalating to the point that he once drilled a hole through his own hand. Another time he had a mysterious infection that wouldn't heal that the drs couldn't figure out, he ended up temporarily with a portable machine that cleaned his blood or something and there were countless other self inflicted injuries throughout my time knowing him.\n\nThe last person was just fucking creepy. Like their house was immaculately clean but completely bare. It had furniture but literally the complete bare minimum. She had a blank expression nearly always, her speech and mannerisms seemed deliberate but delayed, as if she thought about them before she did them. This person made me feel the most uncomfortable out of all three of them, there was something very off about her. Luckily I only ever had to interact with her a few brief times in my life.",
