While they might be based on subconscious processing of information, relying solely on them may not always lead to reliable decisions. It's advisable to balance intuition with critical thinking and objective analysis for more accurate outcomes.",

Now im thinking about it and having this gut feeling that those two actually spent the night together before drinking out, i dont have any evidence yet but i have this very strong gut feeling that they did",
