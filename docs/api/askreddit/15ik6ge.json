The Chips Deluxe, Peacan Sandies used to come in 16-18oz packages and the cookies where in 3 rows going length wise down the packaging. Todays packaging size has shrank and the cookies go horizontally with less cookies. I remember when Sunshine Cheezits came in a 16oz box and the smaller size was a 10oz.
