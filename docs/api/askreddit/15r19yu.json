There was blood however, it was coming from patients leg apparently. Her leg was broken, and it was in abnormal position. End of her leg had broken clean off, her skin was only thing holding it together. It was mangled laying on floor. She asked: \"How does it look?\" and I replied: \"Very bad.\"\n\nWe had no idea how it happened. She was still conscious and not in huge pain. We had problems getting help from the ER or from ambulance. Apparently they didn't think it was that big of priority. When someone did show up.

I had noticed two dogs running along the road unsupervised, and I wanted to go to them but they were very big dogs. Plus I was worried if I left the stop, and the driver saw no one there, the bus would just keep going (it had happened before). \n\nSo I watched the two dogs for a little bit until the pit bull got clipped by a car. I still vividly remember him spinning mid air and off to the side of the road. I REALLY wanted to go see if he was okay but it was so far away. The car didn't swerve to try and avoid him or anything, and it didn't even stop. The other dog stood next to his downed friend the whole time.\n\nEventually a lady pulled over, picked up the dog, and put him (and his buddy) in her truck. I hope the dog was okay, but I'll never know. \n\n(I also had unsupervised internet access growing up, but I feel like the dog was worse somehow. Maybe because I blame myself for not stopping it.)",

But no, the guy fought the other guy off, then left the place and called the cops while holding his shirt over his head to stop the blood from going all over him.\n\nGuys‚Ä¶ like, I‚Äôm not kidding, it was a lot of blood. Like‚Ä¶ 16 feet of blood covering the floor. It legit looked like someone had been stabbed or something. And the smell‚Ä¶ ugh, the smell was the worst! It was gross. It didn‚Äôt smell like metal, which is what I would‚Äôve thought it would smell like. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt smelled anything similar since, so I have nothing to give a reference to, but it smelled bad. Not as bad as rotten food or something like that. It wasn‚Äôt as intense, but it did smell bad. Like a lingering medium level fart. But obviously, it didn‚Äôt actually smell like a fart.\n\nYeah, that memory is INGRAINED in my head. Although now that I think of it, the memory has lost some of its definition. Maybe one day I‚Äôll forget about most of it‚Ä¶ I certainly wouldn‚Äôt mind.\n\nAnother terrible thing I witnessed was someone punching one of my parents in the face, and my parent just‚Ä¶ bleeding from the mouth, and I had to get in there and separate them. That was a rough night.\n\nOh! And also, the day my dog (who at that time belonged to the streets) got run over. The way she was sucked in under the tire‚Ä¶ the memory of it makes me wanna cry. She thankfully survived and I picked her up from the streets and took her to a vet. Fast forward a couple days and she was in my home recovering. Then I adopted her. It‚Äôs been like 5 years since and I LOVE that dog. She‚Äôs my baby. She even sleeps in bed with me. She‚Äôs the sweetest.\n\nOh, I also saw a homeless guy that had his face covered in dried up blood.

The man stopped and got out of his car and while him and my friend were trying to tend to her when they were both hit by a drunk driver. The man that hit her was killed instantly but my friend was still alive I remember him trying to get up screaming her name so we thought that he was going to survive but apparently he was in shock and died on the way to the hospital.

They would‚Äônt send an ambulance because the situation wasn‚Äôt life threatening. I was so furious and scared.

It was basically just us on the sidewalks and cars on the streets. While we were on our way back to the hotel, we see this kid (probably a teenager) running out of a 7/11 with two 6 packs of beer and he was being chased by the store clerk.

The store clerk was smart enough to at least look both ways before following him onto the street. Unfortunately the kid did not. Literally seconds after I warned that he would get hit, a car fucking SMACKS this kid, going probably 45-50 mph. So my friend and I run over to the accident to see if he's ok and this MF is on the ground bleeding profusely, in shock and unable to spit out a single intelligible word or sentence. At that point I knew he was fucked up. \n\nHe stands up and tries to run away but he forgets that he just received heavy brain damage so his legs weren't working the way they were supposed to. I tried to encourage him off the road to lay him in the grass or on the sidewalk at least but before I could bring him to safety his stupid friends in their get away car grab him and shove him in the car to escape the police that were coming. From there I just hoped like hell that they dropped him off at a hospital at the very minimum. I hope he's alive, as unwise and stupid as he may have been that day.",
