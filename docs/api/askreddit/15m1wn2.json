Then they fire 3 people for no reason and make me start working 80 hours a week mandatory. I was making tons of money but was struggling to find time to buy groceries since I worked until late at night. Boss starts micromanaging every little thing while I'm working 16 hr days. Then they wanted me to start training people, said I'd get a 2 dollar an hour raise for doing it, that never happened. Then I had some car issues and I couldn't come in one day. I had to go to Autozone and buy a replacement part. I got the problem solved and was good to go the next day. I never missed a day in six months. My boss called every car shop in town (allegedly), and said that I was lying. I bring the part that I replaced in to show her. She says that's not enough proof and that no one in town said they sold me that part. She wrote me up and then said I might be fired or I might not, and I'll know at the end of the week. I said okay and she asked me if I was coming in tomorrow morning and I said sure. Next day I slept in and never showed up, apparently they're were trucks backed all the way up the road for 4 hours since I didn't show up to open the gate. Boss texts me saying I'll be criminally charged for not showing, I just ignored it so she called me everyday for about a week. I never answered. Found out later that she went on a power trip and fired the people I trained because I \"taught them wrong\" then replaced them with her relatives.

I thought she'd totally lost the plot and resigned when she told me she was certain about the changes.  \n\nShe sold the place a month later and when I got that news it suddenly made sense.  It was still a dick move but at least it had a flavor of logic to it and wasn't just complete disrespect for me with no rationale.  \n\nShe and I have talked and hung out since then so we're back to being friends.

He was a good person who should have never been pushed to that point (and I didn't know it was occurring until he was gone). \n\nL \u0026amp; J, knowing that Y tried to commit suicide because he felt like he'd let people down with his work -- a sentiment that L \u0026amp; J kept assaulting him and his team with -- continued to abuse the rest of the developers the same way and they all were adversely affected, like Y.\n\nI managed the dev team on the company projects, and we had an extremely tight bond. I reinforced daily that each dev mattered, especially after Y. So, when L \u0026amp; J would lie to the devs that I was going to quit because the devs' \"work was shit\" (and various other threatening tactics), I would receive sporadic, hesitant messages from the devs, questioning my loyalty to them. \n\nThere were so many Slacks and calls with devs in order to check on their mental health, support them, and refute bullshit attacks against the team and me. The devs were burnt out, depressed, and wholly alienated at the end of my time there. So was I, but I was very frank with the devs that this was not an environment they deserved. I don't support group-think, and I know that my statements were unprofessional as a manager, but the devs were more important.\n\nI lambasted L \u0026amp; J with a diatribe over how they don't follow their own company edicts surrounding integrity and \"building relationships that last\", and was blown off (\"Thank you for your well-written email\"). \n\nUltimately, I left because I had no influence over the Machiavellian owners' bullshit or protecting the developers. This was just one wretched reason among many, but it was the most damaging, and I couldn't be complicit in their abuse by staying. \n\nL \u0026amp; J told the team that I quit because of the developers (and my failing health...?).

Unbeknownst to me, the office Roomba decided it was the perfect time to explore the outside world. But that's not all ‚Äì my colleague had left their desk chair at an angle, creating an unintentional launchpad.\n\nAs the Roomba ventured into the hallway, it bumped into the chair, setting off a chain reaction that would've made Rube Goldberg proud. The chair shot forward, hitting another chair, which bumped into the water cooler, sending it wobbling precariously. Of course, the water cooler decided to topple at the precise moment the boss walked by, leading to an impromptu indoor waterfall.\n\nThe whole office erupted into a chorus of laughter as the boss stood there, dripping wet and speechless. It was like a scene out of a sitcom. Unfortunately, the boss's drenched suit and the unfortunate timing of the situation didn't exactly bode well for my future at the company. So, with a mixture of chuckles and apologies, my boss and I agreed that it was time for me to move on.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how a rogue Roomba and a runaway office chair race led to my most unexpected and comical exit from a job.
