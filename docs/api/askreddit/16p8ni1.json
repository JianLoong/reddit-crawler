   "message": "Amour - French movie about an old couple.  Just watch it.\n\nMy ex chose a Korean movie and I can't recall the title.  The gist is a divorced mom is raising her high school daughter.  Her daughter goes to a new school and catches the attention of a handsome bad boy classmate.  The boyfriend has a group of deliquent friends and they decide to repeatedly rape and abuse her and shoot videos of it. The girl goes home, tells her mom and they go to the police. The police do nothing due to iirc the parents being somewhat affluent and the parents deny all the charges. No charges are brought forward. The boys blackmail the girl into meeting them by saying they'll spread the video around school if she doesn't come. They abuse her again. The girl goes home and commits suicide. I broke down here probably purely out of anger because besides the mom, no one was doing anything for her. Not even her coward of a father. The mom decides to kill the boys responsible and gets a few of them. The one good cop talks the mom out of killing the last boy and iirc the mom kills herself. At the beginning or the end the movie says it was based on real events. *Fuck.*\n\nGoddamn that movie I'm getting angry just thinking about it lol. I went on a bit of a rant after the movie that kinda shocked my ex.  A lot of \"FUCK everyone in that movie for not doing more\" which led to me telling her, the first person I've ever told, how alone and how depressed I felt growing up and, besides the sexual abuse and me being a male, I *was* that girl in many ways.  We had a tearful but insanely productive and...releasing(?) discussion over bottles of wine for the next couple hours so in the end, I guess thank that movie? Haha.",
