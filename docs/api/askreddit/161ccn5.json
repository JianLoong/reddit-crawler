I heard ppl don‚Äôt like it but how bad could it be since ai grew up on asian palate.  Got anchovies added to my fav pizza and it just ruins the whole thing.

Of all the GF substitutes that exist, pizza crust is one thing that has not been accurately replicated. Good crust is really chewy (I personally love Neapolitan, dusty with flour, burned in some spots, full of big air pockets, and chewy AF); GF crust is more like wet crackers.",
