And given that one of his first accomplishments was being Reagan‚Äôs southern campaign strategist, every bad policy traceable to Reagan is also traceable to Manafort. Furthermore, his firm spent most of its days literally doing PR for Dictators, including Viktor Yanukovych, a Ukrainian dictator so horrific Jews \u0026amp; Neonazis allied against him in revolution. Manafort has also been name dropped in multiple revolutions, the big ones I know of being Ukraine \u0026amp; the Philippines\n\nAnd bonus round asshole meter:\n-Serial adulterer\n-Likely domestic abuser\n-For the first 5 years of his firm got them kicked out of every work party venue they booked\n-Did not invite any of the women who worked for his firm to said work parties because, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be there‚Äù\n\nEdit: If you guys want a bit more of a dive into the things he‚Äôs done, I recommend Behind the Bastards ep. 15, 16, \u0026amp; 33 (Podcast by Robert Evans, a combat reporter who reported from the aforementioned Ukrainian civil war)",
