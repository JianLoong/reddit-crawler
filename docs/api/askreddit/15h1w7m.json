   "message": "I have very flexible joints. As a result, I was well known for doing tricks with my hands during my early uni days. Things like bending my fingers backwards to touch the back of my hand, touching my arm with my thumb, bending fingers into a Z shape etc.\n\nI was at a party with classmates and this girl I vaguely knew asked me for a private demonstration of my hands. I was slightly buzzed at the time so I said sure and took her to the kitchen while she giggled. I started doing my usual tricks but I quickly noticed something was wrong because she got this disappointed look on her face. She mumbled something akin to \"ok cool\" and left the party claiming she was tired, leaving me confused for the rest of the night.\n\nIt took me 3 days of sobering up before I realized I had fucked up and by the time I saw her again it was too awkward to talk about.",

I was sooo flustered I excused myself to go get a drink. I gathered my thoughts in the kitchen, got a drink, and when i came back, they were leaving. They went to their car, turned around to look at me, and laughed and then left.",

   "message": "In high school. Went over to my friend’s house about a 2 minute walk from my house. Drinking and hanging out. I didn’t realize we would be drinking, so maybe 15 minutes after I got there I said “alright, give me 10 minutes. I’ll be right back. I have a bottle of gin at my house, and I’m gonna go grab it real quick.”\n\nOne of the girls there said she’d come with me. I explained that there was no need. It’s just a few hundred yards away. I’ll just jog down there and be back in 5 minutes. She said she’ll come anyway. I thought it was odd but didn’t think much of it and said, “alright then. Let’s go.”\n\nWe get to my house and go down to my hiding spot in the basement. My parents are gone, so there’s no one else in the house. I grab it, look at her, and straight to her face say “alright, let’s go.” We walk back down to my friend’s.\n\nIt was a couple weeks later that it hit me. She 100% wanted to come with me alone to my parents’ house so that we could hook up. I guess it was because I’d never thought of her like that. She was decent looking but not a stunner. Not someone I’d probably hook up with sober. But I still feel bad about how demoralizing that must have been for her. She sent all the signals short of just jumping me, and it went straight over my head.",
