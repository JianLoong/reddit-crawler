   "message": "Love hurts and you do feel like you wasted time but give it time and trust me, journaling does work, especially pro and con style for a guy and some women. It also helps you see what positivity you got out of it and what negativity leached from it so that you don't repeat the same mistake and it helps you move on much faster. If the cons outweigh the pros you are way ahead of the game and even if they're equal ?   you're still learning something about yourself and what you need in a relationship.   I know you can do it, everybody can, let yourself grieve, drink, smoke, whatever you have to do to get through it just don't continue it and fall apart ‚ÄºÔ∏èdo the damn journal and work on yourself. Really does work. Caveat might be after 4 weeks of slumping in a chair binge watching scandal or any long-term TV show while knocking back cheap bubbly wine and bourbon and Coke and refusing to go out because you just want to hibernate and sleep but this too shall pass. The journaling blew my mind and I'm someone who had to do it in a pro/con list so I was really able to see the good and the bad and what I needed to work on and what I really needed to look for so I wish you well and just know that this will passü•∫ Barry Manilow and his Fanilows had it right, you'll know when you're ready to take a chance again and you'll be much better prepared for that.",
