   "message": "We are one and done (kiddo is 11). A few factors that went into the decision:\n\n- I absolutely hated being pregnant. I was so uncomfortable the entire time. She was situated so high my boobs were practically at my chin. \n\n- I had a horrible, scary labor and delivery. Had to be induced because I was overdue. Labored 36 hours before getting to 10cm. Pushed for 4 hours but couldn‚Äôt get her out. Ended up with an emergency c-section. I was so out of it after I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd given birth until a few hours later (I was wondering why everyone was talking so loudly but it was the doctors trying to keep me alive). Had some complications after due to my ulcerative colitis and ended up staying in the hospital for 6 extra days. My recovery took a lot longer. \n\n- Honestly though, I could have surmounted those things. The biggest issue for me was I wasn‚Äôt making a huge salary at the time and daycare cost pretty much my entire take home pay each month. (Husband‚Äôs salary paid the rest of the bills.) I quite literally couldn‚Äôt afford a second kid. \n\n- That said, when kiddo was 3, I switched jobs and ended up tripling my salary. (Same position but now I worked in tech.) I wasn‚Äôt eligible for (unpaid!) maternity leave until I‚Äôd been there for a year and by the time I was eligible, I was rocketing up the career ladder at my company and didn‚Äôt want to mess it up (I still work here and I am now exec level). \n\n- Also, my child didn‚Äôt sleep through the night until she was 18 months old. I never once pulled an all nighter in college but there were so many times I had to get on that train to NYC for work without ever having closed my eyes the night before. \n\n- My husband was okay with whatever I decided. \n\nAnyway, all of those reasons factored into why we only have one kid. We are a very happy family though and I‚Äôm super glad we made the decision we did!",
