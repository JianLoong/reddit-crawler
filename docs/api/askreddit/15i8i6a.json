The event that did it was him fighting with one of the male teachers after sending him out of the class for talking shit to one of the students. He refused to leave and when the teacher tried to call security the kid started punching him. Like not soft hitting like what some kids would do if they threw tantrums, but full blown punches. This kid wasn‚Äôt very big for a fifth grader but he could pack a punch. (The teacher wasn‚Äôt very built either, he was maybe 5‚Äô10? Slimish build, and this is just to my best memory) anyway it took like three staff and a security guard to pry this kid off the teacher and by then all of the kids including myself cradled in the corner. The kid go expelled, and the teacher quit I believe? I‚Äôm not really sure. We didn‚Äôt see him for a good 2 months (mid school year) I heard from gossip among the teachers, bad kid broke his ribs or something like that. He came back to the finish the semester and after that quit. Though I was already heading to sixth grade so I‚Äôm not sure.

We had some kids come and go over the years, but the majority of the people I graduated with were also 2nd grade classmates.  In Jr High we had a kid come in, we'll call him Danny.  He was a total asshole, and he basically fractured our class from one cohesive group into cliques.  He and a couple of otherwise good kids basically became the school bullies.  It was bad enough that we had many substitute teachers quit after having our class.  Somehow they were always just careful enough to not cross a line to get into too much trouble.\n\nOur senior year my class planned to take a weekend trip to a semi-local amusement park as our \"senior sneak\" trip.  During the senior year Danny and his posse were worse than ever, to the point that many of us were not going to go on the senior trip, despite working our butts off doing carwashes and other fundraisers from Jr. High on in order to fund the trip.\n\nA few weeks before the trip, Danny and one of the others from his clique did something and got expelled.  I don't know the full details, but it had something do do with physical violence against our school counselor.  It was an overnight change in the dynamics of our class.  It was like the cliques disappeared.  Even the other Danny-followers that were left changed their attitudes and were nice to everyone again.  We all went on the trip and had a great time.  Graduation came and went, we had a PTA-sponsored overnight graduation party, then after that was over we all went and had a party at a nearby lake.\n\nI don't know what it was with Danny, but it was like an old cartoon where he was the bad guy that put a town under a spell, and once the superhero kicked his ass, the whole town went back to normal.  I wouldn't have believed something like that was possible had I not seen it myself.  I don't know what ever happened to him.  Despite the things he did to me and my friends, both directly and indirectly, I wish him well.  I hope that was a wakeup call and he turned his life around and made something of it.
