   "message": "Not listening to it.\n\nSounds like bullshit, but hear me out. Whenever I get a craving, it's usually a sign that I'm low on a certain vitamin, mineral, or other kind of thing that my body needs; I think it's an inherent skill most of us have that you gotta nurture overtime to fully use. Like if I'm really craving a salad, I know I'm probably hella low on some vitamins I haven't been eating. If I'm craving something sour like a fruit, I'm probably low on vitamin C. If I really want a burger or other form of beef, I'm low on iron. Usually when I eat what I'm craving in lower or moderate amounts, I tend to feel a lot better and my mood gets better. At first I thought it was just because I was satisfying the craving, but after experimenting with certain food (like eating more fruit and going healthier routes when it came to the protein/meat), I got the same affect even when it was stuff I'm not a huge fan of.\n\nSame thing for moving around. I can't sit for longer than a few hours before I have to get up and do something else. I think our bodies are better at telling us what we need when we actually need it, but it's paying more attention and thinking more methodically about what we're actually doing/eating to help both our mental and physical health. I could very easily just be full of shit though, so take it with a grain of salt lmao.",
