Top-level comments should mimic regular thread titles, as questions for the child-comments to answer. Non-question top-level comments will be removed, to keep the thread as easy to use and navigate as possible.*\n\nUse this thread for asking fellow redditors questions about all things Halloween-related, from costume ideas, to best memories, to favorite scary movies, and anything and everything else. And please. feel free to browse it by /new to contribute to new discussions as they arise!",
