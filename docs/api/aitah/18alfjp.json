 "selftext": "My sister asked to use my house to throw her son’s 9th birthday party because my house is bigger and my nephew wanted to invite kids from his class. I didn’t mind at all and let her. The party is happening and there were about 7 kids from class and then 5 of his cousins here. 4 of the parents stayed for the party which was fine. One boy needed to leave half way through because he had another party to go to. He wanted my nephew to open the gift he got before he left so my sister agreed. The child had gotten my nephew some candy and a few toys. As my nephew pulled candy out of the bag he proceeded to tell everyone “I do NOT like these here you can just have them back.” I said “that was a little rude, (sister) you need to teach (nephew) some manners, he shouldn’t tell someone he doesn’t like the gift they got him.” She proceeded to get loud and say “excuse me I teach my kids that if they don’t like something someone gives them they need to tell them so they don’t get it for them again!” I was in disbelief she said this. I just wandered into the living room. No one said anything more about it. I am sitting here playing the screen over in my head thinking maybe I am wrong for saying that? Maybe she is right? Idk. I need to put my mind to rest about this.",
