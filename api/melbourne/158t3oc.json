 "selftext": "Keep multiple backups and as much proof that you have done your own work - for example, screenshots, search history, etc.  One major university (possibly more) has been incorrectly targeting students for the use of generative AI.  The disciplinary process for this is extremely daunting and will nit pick every little detail (such as using abbreviations, not the whole elaboration).\n\nIn my experience I was proven innocent as I provided screenshots + search histories + edited and non-edited versions.  Despite this, they continue to target me since I have to use a recording software (I assume only students who have been accused, because my other colleagues don't have to use it).  A bit frustrating as other work submitted I see are blatantly AI and not getting noticed.",

You are being punished, through an egregious breach of privacy, for *not* cheating. Talk to your student union ASAP. I wouldn't imagine they have any standing whatsoever to make you use a recording software on your own time, on your own computer - especially if you haven't done anything wrong in the first place.",
