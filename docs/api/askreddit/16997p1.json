   "message": "Stickdeath - they had a bunch of hilarious stick figure videos and games. They inspired the stick figure trend of the early 2000s.\n\nNewgrounds - was a site for flash animations and movies. They are really good. I recommend looking up \"Akuma vs Chameleon.\"\n\nActionflash - this site was full of flash games from fighting games to dating sims. One of their most popular titles is called \"Bloody Rage.\"\n\n\nStickpage - this site was everything stick figure from games to skits and even movies! What made them big was the trending at the time \"Xiao Xiao\" series, which inspired 99% of all stick fight animations. Also, another series called \"Flair\" was really good. Xiao Xiao was like a Jackie Chan movie, but Flair was like an action anime.\n\nGeocities - Think if Google and Startpage had a baby. That site had everything,  even stuff you didn't search for! That website had no filter and connected to both the surface and deep web without separation. Links 1 - 5 would be what you are looking for. 6 and up would be like, gross footage from the Iraq war.\n\nMugenguild - MUGEN was the shiiiiiiiit!!!!! Mugen got me into so many other series I didn't give a crap about like King of Fighters. I legit bought King of Fighters because of MUGEN. I had a Ryu someone modified to throw bags of McDonald's instead of hadoukens. I also had this girl named Ella who looked like the girl from The Ring. She was badass!! I also had a Chun li or R Mika that raped people. I had Evil Ryu and Violent Ken but the Alpha versions. I had Broly too!!! He was notoriously OP.\n\nZipperfish - this site was for men by men. It was everything you thought your dad's watched and thought.  They had this game called \"Boobs, Butt, or Shoulder\" which was surprisingly difficult. They zoomed into an image and you had to guess which one of the three it was. You'll  see a straight line and think, \"Shoulder obviously. Boobs and butts are curved.\" Then they zoom out to show a flat ass in a bikini.",
