KISS is a mediocre band at best, run by a relentless marketing and merchandising genius who will do anything for a buck. Nobody in the band ever creeps into the \"Best X\" (as in best lead singer, guitarist, et al) conversations. (Which is kind of a shame, Paul Stanley is one of the more engaging and entertaining lead singers of his era.) And they've proven that the whole thing is pretty much copy and paste. Various members have rotated through the band over the years, and you never notice because the music is basic and formulaic. Gene Simmons has also opined that KISS should go on once he and Paul finally quit. It's not about the performers or even the music. It's about the spectacle.",
