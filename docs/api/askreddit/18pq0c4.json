   "message": "Getting dressed. When covid hit and we started working from home and my daughter was doing school from home. By August I would stay in my pjs all day. For me that's normally a nightgown or just a big shirt and I would throw a pair of pj pants on when I went out to the couch. No bra or anything. What followed was I started just throwing my long thick hair into a ponytail most mornings instead of brushing my hair. Not brushing hair meant it turned into a knotted mess which meant I put off showering as often because I'd have to brush through my hair. Wearing PJs from sun up to sun down and wore on my mental health more than I realized. I thought I was just being \"comfy\". I get dressed now and part of that routine means brushing my hair even if I throw it into a ponytail.",
