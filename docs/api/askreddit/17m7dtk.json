I'm fucking done with that. \n\nIf I click with someone and love them, then I accept them exactly as they are. I have never asked a partner to change anything about themselves. Never have, never will. From here on out this acceptance will either be reciprocated or I'm out. I'm the master of my own growth, thanks. \n\nSadly this appears to be a tall enough order that it qualifies as a \"restriction\".",
