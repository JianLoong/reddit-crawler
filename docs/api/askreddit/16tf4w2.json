   "message": "[Kobe Beef](https://www.feel-kobe.jp/en/pickup/kobe_beef/), at least the most-marbled types.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I LIVE in Kobe, Japan, and have had it many times, have tried all the various levels of quality at some point. But the highest-quality Kobe Beef is SO marbled with fat that it's practically white, not red. Once cooked, even \"rare,\" you're left with a fine mesh of barely-interconnected meat cells that melt instantly in your mouth, no chewing required.\n\nUh, excuse me...? I prefer meat I can enjoy chewing, please. So when I buy Kobe Beef now, I always get a lower-ranked type. It's much cheaper, and it feels like I'm eating actual meat. (My wife loves the most expensive stuff, of course!)\n\nWARNING: the vast majority of claimed \"Kobe Beef\" sold worldwide is faked. Kobe exports a fairly small amount of beef, much going in small lots to select restaurants, and it's often shipped by air. If you have had \"Kobe Beef\" anywhere outside Kobe, Japan itself, it's a fair bet you were cheated. Even here in Japan, faked Kobe Beef is a problem, as there are few food inspectors to find the shops and penalize them.\n\nHowever, the website linked below maintains a COMPLETE and accurate list of all restaurants worldwide authorized and registered to sell actual Kobe Beef.
