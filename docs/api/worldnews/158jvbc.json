   "message": "Fascism is actually fucking disastrous for business and everywhere from Israel to Florida we see businesses fleeing from governments that go full on fascist.\n\nWhen you don't have an independent judiciary, I, as a startup, could start a business, only for the government to seize it and leave me no recourse because the government owns the judges and they simply refuse to even hear my case.\n\nThink about the fact that in the US, if the government wants to take action against a citizen, they must enter proceedings through a court, where an independent judiciary ensures that there is at least as much fairness and procedure as possible.\n\nThis is essential to any free country.  One of the most essential elements.\n\nNetanyahu is a dictator and has abandoned the pretense of democracy.  No one should allow this to stand, and it will have the greatest negative effect on the Israeli people themselves",

   "message": "Right wing parties are terrible for the economy.  Right wingers ruin every country they control.  They are not \"pro-business\" as they often claim.  Right wingers are LIARS.  Never trust them and never put them in power, and if they ever do get power, do what you can to remove them from power.  The survival of every nation depends on keeping right wingers out of power.  Right wingers betray every nation they control.  Right wingers are the biggest threat to the national security of every country, mainly because they can attack from within.  They have an advantage that no external enemy has.  Netanyahu and his allies have done more damage to Israel than all of Israel's foreign enemies combined.  They are the only ones who can destroy Israel and they are succeeding.  I hope the protesters continue blocking roads.  They should also block the business entrances of every business that supports or funds Netanyahu and his allies.",
