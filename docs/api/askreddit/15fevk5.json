I made because it was just too wild not to try it and it just...worked. I still make the sandwich every so often, it's really good.\n\n**Edit:** [this is one adaptation of the sandwich](https://www.eatwell.com/thisweeksbox/2017/3/21/no-7-broccoli-sub) based off of No 7 sandwich shop in NYC; it has ricotta salata, but the tv had adapted it with feta, which I much prefer. The version I use also doesn't bother with pine nuts (I don't find them necessary). Last time I posted about this sandwich, someone mentioned that there's a place (in Ohio, I think?) that also now does a version of this sandwich.",
