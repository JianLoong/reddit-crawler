I worked in production warehouses for 20 years, and staying at home with my beautiful son is the best gig I've ever had.\n\nBeing a stay at home parent definitely has challenges, but dealing with an actual child is much easier than dealing with adults who act like children.\n\nEdit: I am in no way saying it's easy. It definitely is not, but it is the most rewarding, and that makes it way more worthwhile than working for some CEO that shits on a golden toilet. (I apologize for my crassness.)\n\nEdit 2: I do not work in the warehouse anymore, but I am earning a degree online.\n\nEdit 3: Someone said it perfectly. It is a privilege. \nNow that I think about it, a profession is something you get paid for. So SAHP is not a profession and, therefore, does not belong in this thread.  \n\nThis is my first post with over 1k upvotes, so that's cool... üòÜ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nObviously, my situation is different from others. Nothing in this life is ever black or white. Everything is a shade of gray. I'm just saying STHM's are the only people I have ever heard say that their job is the hardest. \nI have heard people say that POTUS is the hardest job. I tend to believe that.\n\nLast Edit: In the days before the Civil Rights Movement, I would agree. It was definitely the hardest job in the world. I never have to worry about my husband coming home and kicking my ass cause dinner wasn't cooked to his specifications. \n\nThat's why I am a liberal. When I hear someone say make America Great Again it enrages me. When was it great? When men could beat their wives with no repercussions. IDK, that's just me.",
