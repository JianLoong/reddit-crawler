   "message": "I know I'm lucky, compared to some in my position. I don't have to hide my condition, or hide away from settlements out of fear for both them and me.\n\nIt happened nearly seven winters ago. I was stumbling back from the tavern, along the road that leads out to my mill, when the beast attacked. I was found the next morning, savaged but alive. The village healer knew what my wounds were as soon as she set eyes on me.\n\nWere I anyone else, I would have been cast out if I survived without the healer's help. The same for if this village was larger. In a large enough town, I'd have been murdered where I lay, by some overly zealous adherent of the faith.\n\nBut this isn't a larger village, and I'm not anyone else. I'm the miller, the only one for three day's ride in any direction. I'm the only one who knows how to operate the mill, which everyone here relies on. It's not an easy skill to learn, and none who live here have shown the aptitude for the magic.\n\nAnd so my condition is managed. The smith and the carpenter devised covers for the windows and doors of the mill, operable only from the outside. The lord himself sends men to ensure their closure on the nights of the moon, with me inside. \n\nOr, rather, he _sent_ men. The lord was called to war six moons past, and he took all but a handful of his soldiers with him. None returned, and we got the word this past week. They were ambushed, the entire contingent slaughtered to a man. Our lord's head was returned to the king in a bag, his tongue severed and replaced with his hands.\n\nWe said our prayers to his soul, unable to ascend and condemned to wander the mortal lands forever due to this abhorrent mutilation.\n\nAnd then we got the word of the lord sent to replace him, a cousin raised in the capital. In the centre of the faith. One of the zealots who would see me murdered.\n\nHe has ordered my seizure, and the seizure of my lands and my homes. The former is not much, just a small garden where I grow some vegetables and a few herbs that I trade to the healer in exchange for the pain draughts she brews from them. But the mill, that is not just _my_ livelihood, but the lifeblood of the village.\n\nAnd he has not brought a miller to replace me, that much is known. So the men of the village are gathered outside of my home, armed as best as they can manage, to resist my punishment. Because to punish me is to condemn them all. Without me their grain does not get milled, there is no flour to make bread, no hreth to offer in worship at the temple.\n\nWithout me we don't get the protection of the gods, against the beasts that lurk in the forest. The last time we failed to make the proper offering was nearly seven winters ago, when a storm damaged my mill.\n\nI can hear the cries of the lord's men now, shouting at the villagemen to disperse and let them \"take the beast\". I can hear through the covers that they've pulled over the doors and window, to protect me instead of themselves this time.\n\nI am writing this in between bouts of production. I don't believe that my neighbours - my _friends_ - will be able to hold off the trained soldiers of our lord. If they can buy me enough time, I can hopefully produce enough hreth to tide them over until a new miller is found, then perhaps no one else will suffer my fate.\n\nOr worse. A werewolf is not the most dangerous thing that lurks outside of the faith's shields, after all.",

   "message": "I had considered myself lucky up until now. The villagers protected me despite the transformation, locking me in my house so I wouldn't afflict any others with my condition.\n\nYears ago when I had been bitten, I had started packing my things to leave, wished the rest of the town goodbye. I had plans to go far away, where no humans were, and live in solitude.\n\nBut the townspeople, Old Bertrand the Baker, Willow the Dairy Farmer and her 10 strong sons, the girls down at the pub, even Tiffany the town guard, they all refused to let me do that to myself. Instead, they helped me build barricades around my little cottage, easy to drop down when the full moon came. Along with the chain and collar I had bolted to the stone fireplace myself. Tight when I transformed, but as the beast I had no thumbs to unlatch the collar.\n\nBut now....\n\nThe decree hung loosely upon my door. On half the doors in town. A new lord, appointed by the king, was claiming our homes for his men. We all had to be moved out within two months.  Two moons of time, and my home, my carefully secured domicile, would be lost.\n\nIt hadn't escaped notice either that the untouched houses were those that belonged to single women or families with daughters. Willow with her 10 sons was being asked to leave, but Tiffany and her 6 daughters, not one over 15, were left behind.\n\nAnd myself...despite being a single woman, the rumors by now had surely reached the Lord and the army. A cursed girl. A witch. A monster.\n\nPartially true, all of those tales.\n\nBut now...\n\nI begrudgingly started packing my things. It wasn't much, I'd had the bag planned from the time I was turned, after all. Easy to grab and go.\n\nA cough behind me broke me out of my packing. \"Ahem....Lyra. What do you think you are doing?\"\n\nI turned, wincing as I saw Tiffany's bulk in my doorway. She had taught me to fight, as she taught all the town's children. As she taught her own daughters.\n\n\"I figured, I was asked to leave and I can't be living with anyone, so I may as well start going now so I'm not a danger to anyone else on the road.\"\n\nTiffany looked thoughtful. \"Aye, lass, I figured you'd do as much. 'tis why I came here when I saw those confounded papers about town. However, we have a plan for that, if you'd be so kind as to come to the council meeting tonight.\"\n\nI stared dumbly at her, my mouth half open. Tiffany raised an eyebrow at me and tapped her foot. I gulped and nodded.\n\n\\---\n\nThat night, the council was packed with the adults of the town. When I arrived, I could hear shouting and arguing from outside, along with punctuated versions of \"this uppity lord\" and \"purebred mongrel\". It seemed everyone was upset.\n\nAs I entered, however, the arguments stopped, and all eyes were on me.\n\nBertrand, at the head of the table, was the first to speak. \"Come here, Lyra, and hear our plan.\" He gestured at the empty chair next to him, and continued to speak as I walked up. \"We have known for some time that a new lord would be appointed our lands eventually, and like all new lords, he is of the mind of replacing our people with his own, profiting off of the homes our mothers and fathers built long ago.\n\n\"However, as we have been planning since young Lyra was bitten, we can barricade our own homes as well. The secondary safety measures can keep out a werewolf, so a human soldier will be hard pressed to find a way in without resorting to fire. However, we don't plan to die in flames.\n\n\"Lyra, child, we plan to lock our own doors and let you wander free. We have been planning this for awhile, as locking you up and listening to your howling breaks all our hearts. If you wander freely, the rumor of a huge beast haunting our city will come true. And when the soldiers come, the wolf shall have freedom. When the Lord marches in, you will be free. Do you wish to accept this risk?\"\n\nI looked at the faces around me. Eyes, shining with hope. Not one of them afraid I would hurt them? Not one afraid I would turn on those I care about. I gulped nervously, and then met Tiffany's eyes. There was a light in them, shining brightly. More than hope, she believed in me.\n\nMy own voice was distant to my ears. \"Yes, I can try.\"\n\n\\---\n\n*Moon bright and shiny in sky. No leather noose on neck this time. Freedom?*\n\n*Bang bang bang from the...door? Yeah, it's a door, can't open with paws. Normally has bar but not this time. Seems....loose? Oh right, the human me left the bar off this time. Remember...have to remember...*\n\n*Bang bang CRASH.*\n\n*Door open!! There's men with pointy things in my territory. The one who broke my door, his eyes meet mine for a second. My nose twitches. he smells of fear. Did he...mark my territory? He lets out a shriek and turns to run. Oh a chase!*\n\n*I leap on his back and bite. His screaming stops, his eyes stay open. I shake him once to be sure. Oops, I think I killed him?*\n\n*I see another soldier, banging on another door trying to get in. My nose puts a name to the door. That's Bertrand's house!! His smell was there on full moons when he'd be outside my cage to sing with me.*\n\n*I howled a greeting and the soldier turned. This one yelled something, and pulled a shiny sword from his waist.* \n\n*I greeted him with my jaws as well.* \n\n*All through the town, soldiers either ran or died.* \n\n\\----\n\nThe next day, I woke up in a barn and puked, remembering the blood I had shed. \n\nEach body on my conscience, the more my stomach rebelled. \n\nTiffany was there though, rubbing my back and making me drink water.\n\nAnd a week later, the lord had a new pronouncement. \n\nWe could keep our homes. As long as we kept the beast contained.",

   "message": "I tilted my head, mind not quite comprehending what my ears had heard. \"...Are you serious?\" \n\nThe lord, newly 'appointed' over our town, scoffed at me. \"Of course I am. Me telling you to tell the rest of the village is a formality that I decided to follow.\"\n\n...He didn't know.\n\nOur village had a *very minor* werewolf problem. People who are good at medicine and alchemy and the like are very hard to come by, so we couldn't just kill him or whatever. If anything, his condition usually helped him. Much easier to smell out herbs and such when you sometimes have wolf senses. Just had to make sure to tie him up when the full moon was coming, which he was aware of and willing to do.\n\nThe issue is that... werewolves. The good news was that this lord clearly didn't know about it. The bad news was that... he was going to very quickly.\n\n\"Are you listening?\" I snapped back to attention.\n\n\"Apologies,\" I said with a slight curtsy. \"That building and land belongs to our town's medicine man. If you take it-\"\n\nThe lord waved his hand dismissively. \"What happens to your town is none of my concern,\" he interrupted coldly. \"I will be arriving within the week.\" I bit the inside of my lip but nodded. I couldn't exactly *say no,* not  if I valued my life, which I did.\n\n\"I'll be sure to inform the rest of the villagers.\" The lord nodded, turning and waving his hand.\n\n\"You're dismissed.\" I bowed, turned, and walked out of the room.\n\n...I had an idea. A stupid, foolish, idiotic idea that would surely result in the death of all involved if it didn't work.\n\nBut it *was* an idea.",

   "message": "I'm the only brewer and baker in town.  Everyone gets their beer and bread at my pub, women bring pies and stews to bake in my oven during the day, and in general the village relies on me.  It's a little village on the edge of nowhere in particular, so we don't really have anyone else to rely on or trade with.  I always give them fair deals when I trade with them, I help out when help is needed, and in general I try to be a good friend.  Without me, the lives of everyone in the village would be a lot harder.\n\nSo when I was bitten by that strange wolf, I tried to hide it.  I was successful for several months, but then one night I managed to break out of my basement in my beastly form. Luckily, I only savaged old Mrs. Gravis's chickens.  But my secret was out.\n\nI can't say I was all that surprised when the villagers were willing to help me instead of banishing me. After all, most of them had known me my entire life, and I was the only one who really knew how to run the ovens. So the best carpenter in the village helped me reinforce my basement door, everyone knew to take their chickens in on a full moon night, and except for my little difficulty, things went on pretty much as they always had.\n\nAnd then that arrogant lord came. He said some king we had never even heard of had given him the land. He said we owed him taxes.  He and his men strutted around the village like cockerels. He began to have his way with the local maidens, whether they wanted his advances or not.  But the last straw, at least for me, was when he decided that a mere woman couldn't be allowed to run the pub and bakery. He announced that he was going to take it from me, and give it to one of his retainers to run.\n\nHe was foolish or unlucky enough to announce this on the day before the full moon. All the villagers know about me, and they know to keep their doors locked, their windows shuttered, and their livestock inside. That arrogant lord knows none of these things. And I won't be locking my basement door tonight.",

   "message": "A home is a man's castle. Wether a peasant or a King, this is true. The village of Valune, they called my small, humble mill the Chateau, the most important building they had.\n\nSurrounded by fields of gold, tilled by me and mine since time immemorial. \n\nThe fruits of that labour ground into white powder by  the power of the wind. Sails sewn by the fingers of ancestors long passed.\n\nI was all that was left, the only one who knew the secrets of the ground. The seasons, the howls of the wind. Now waiting, as time ground my bones to dust, as it did the grain.\n\nNone from the village took to the words of the ground or its blessings. None could understand the plough. I despaired. \n\nAnd then, foul beast! Terrible, wonderous beast! It bit me, deep and strong!\n\nI writhed in agony for days. Yet I healed. Pain fled my aching bones, the clock wound back and though I still looked a withered man, I worked as ten men strong! \n\nOh golden grain, I harvested, put to mill stone, and so kept the village safe from famine winter long. The price, however was something I kept to myself. Barricaded in the 'Chateau'. Inescapable to beast, made of stone that could not be breached by man or beast alike.\n\nBut only so much can be done by one man alone, however strong, the howls brought curiosity, and thus did my wretched state become discovered. The Mayor put to a vote wether I should be allowed to live , near unanimously was the vote of yes. No harm had come to the people of Valune as long as I had been around, and so they said it must be my doing. \n\nIt was of course, not so.\n\nThus did the ritual start, and so did the coming doom .\n\nEvery moon the Chateau lived to its name, a fortress did it become, protected, fortified and kept locked tight to keep me from the thing I feared and craved.\n\nYet so the word of prosperous Chateau grew, and protection grew. The village was then carefully selected by a Lord, young and foolish, who did say the lands all thus belonged to him and him alone. Any attempt to hold anything from him, would be met with force. \n\nHis men, upon that fateful night, came to ensure that no one would bar the Lord from seeing what was within the Chateau.\n\nSo no one stopped him and his men, so politely let him in, and locked it up behind.",
