   "message": "I was 13 (21 now), and I was in a pediatric oncology ward. Me and this boy were both there for cancer treatment, for a similar type of cancer. We had met a bunch of times and both really liked each other in that awkward 13 year old way. He had gotten a very pessimistic updated prognosis and was understandably very upset. He mentioned that he'd never kissed a girl, so I kissed him. The next time he saw me he gave me a rose and asked me if I wanted to go on a date with him once we both started feeling a little better, and I said yes. We never got to go on the date, he died shortly after of a seizure related to his tumor.",
