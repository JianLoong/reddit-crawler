   "message": "We went to a wedding for a family member who didn't have much money. It was held at a low-cost yet pleasant location. My heart was broken when just one-third of those invited showed up. The couples' faces were filled with pain. They approached our table and asked if we had any acquaintances in (city, we lived an hour away)? They had enough food for 100 people, but only 30 people showed up. They were prepared to have total strangers come down simply to avoid wasting their money and food. We hadn't yet handed them our cash-filled card, so my husband went to the ATM and added another $100.",

An aunt of mine was sitting closer to the camera and spent the evening commenting and gossiping about everyone, and much of it came out on the video. The cameraman was great, he did two copies, one edited and the other no holds barred...The unedited version is the stuff of legend.",

   "message": "My nephew is highly allergic to peanuts and was the ring bearer in a wedding when he was very young. The bride and groom made sure that the venue, the caterers, whoever made the cake, all knew that there should be no peanut-containing or contaminated food on the premises for their wedding. No one thought to tell the DJ though, and the DJ brought peanuts as a snack. He held my nephew's hand walking him into the reception and my nephew had a serious reaction. He was ok in the end, fortunately the EpiPen did work in his case, but it certainly put a damper on the reception after he had to leave for the hospital.\n\nIt was pretty scary, and I share that story hoping that if any other brides/grooms have a loved one with a peanut allergy, make sure you tell eeeeevverybody that might set foot in your wedding venue.",

After the ceremony, right at the start of the reception - photographer was taking ‚Äòjumping‚Äô photos of the bride and bridesmaids, so they were all jumping in the air while wearing heels. Bride landed and dislocated her knee, then passed out and kept going in and out of consciousness. We called an ambulance who turned up and fixed her knee etc, but she wanted to continue with the wedding. She then had the first course of the meal and threw up down her dress, and had to sit with her mum in another room while everyone else danced etc. Felt so bad for her as she spent the rest of the evening crying.",

Then the bride appears with her father. She takes 3 or 4 steps down the concrete steps and her shoe twists on her, she tumbled down a good 12 feet or more and busted out the majority of her front teeth in the fall. So much blood all over her.\n\nWith the place being so isolated, it took a good 40 minutes for ambulance to arrive and she was in intense pain. Ultimately she was ok and I got an email from them weeks later with the reschedule date. This time there was no stairs anywhere in sight.",

Something like 60/100 people showed up (there was a snow storm involved) and the bride, without missing a beat, invited all of the venue staff (including people who weren't even working the wedding) to come eat and dance.\n\nBride's mother ended up playing DJ for ~an hour (with the exact same no-nonsense attitude as her daughter) so the band could propertly sit down for dinner and the groom and his groomsmen, still in tux shirts/pants, insisted on helping load out even though it was basically just a drum kit and couple speakers.\n\nI have no idea who these people were but would bet money I can't afford to lose that they're still happily married. :)",

The place was overcrowded. You could barely move without bumping into someone else and in the heat that was extra miserable.\n\nI guess the air conditioning problem had also affected the refrigeration or something because most of the food was spoiled. The only food on the buffet was salad, spaghetti and rolls. Not enough to feed even half the guests.\n\nMost people left after the first dance.
