My mom wasn't even pushing too hard for me to get treatment because everyone in our family had it - you just lather yourself in lotion and creams and move on with your day. \n\nBut my mom decided to take me to a dermatologist just in case. They generally take your vitals when you first walk in. When they took my pulse, it was at 180 bpm. This was highly unusual since i had been sitting in the waiting room for half an hour, and the resting heartbeat of a child is usually between 60-80 bpm. They thought the 180 reading was an accident, but the results freaked me out and my bpm shot up to 200. I immediately got sent to the ER and was ultimately diagnosed with an arrhythmia. \n\nWhat's funny in retrospect is that I had those heart problems throughout my childhood, but no doctor could ever catch it when it was actually taking place, so I went ~10 years of my life without any sort of diagnosis. It's because of that random dermatologist appointment that I was diagnosed properly - and i had a corrective heart procedure last summer! So I'm all fixed now!",

A couple years ago, we switched over to vaping for health reasons and admittedly mostly for financial reasons. After a few months, I noticed I was losing a lot of weight without exercising more  or anything and that's when I realized I was losing weight because I wasn't snacking. I noticed that whenever I was in our kitchen lighting coals for our next bowl, I would just end up snacking on whatever I saw. This led to me being much more aware of exactly how much I was snacking and how little self control I have. I still struggle with the self control part so I don't really buy anything I am able to snack on anymore, I buy frozen food for the most part, and I have my wife hide her snacks so I'm not tempted. So far in the last 2 years, I have lost 76 pounds (34kgs). It has been life changing for me, my knees and back hurt less, I'm more comfortable, and I sleep better. The downside is that I had a really hard time keeping my pants pulled up since I was already built like Hank Hill with no ass and there's nothing for my belt to grab onto, no matter how much I tighten my belt. I feel like a new person and am excited to continue losing weight, especially because last year, I decided to start cutting my own wood for our wood stove instead of buying firewood. Cutting and splitting 4 cords of firewood throughout the year can be a pretty good workout.",

There were two seats available, one next to my best friend and one right behind a beautiful blonde. I handed the paperwork to the teacher, turned around and she said \"this seat's open\". I looked at my friend and he just shook his head, cause what do you think I was going to do? We've been inseparable ever since. Just about 28 years ago probably end of September. Two grown daughters and we still like each other quite a bit.",

   "message": "Decided to take a logistics class in college, and liked it and pursued the logistics certificate offered. This was basically run by one professor, who was a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nHe gave me a flyer for a federal job brief for the federal government. I gave them a copy of my resume. Somehow, a Navy recruiter got it from that person and recruited me to be a Naval Officer. I applied, and it was a 4% selection rate that year (2010, horrendous hiring conditions for new graduates). I had a letter of rec from my retired LTCL which helped me get selected from the pool of 450 applicants that quarter.\n\nDid 9 years Active Duty, still in the reserves today and I work for the Navy as a civilian now.\n\nThanks Dr. Haas!",

   "message": "I was beginning to come to terms with the fact I'm transgender again, I'd done it before but always denied and repressed myself back into the closet. So I made a reddit account with a new name I liked (this one) and started exploring transgender subs to see if I could relate to the posts. Someone had posted a question asking if anyone wanted to chat. I normally don't answer those kinds of things but was bored and confused in my identity so decided \"why not?\" and messaged her. Over the next almost 2 years she's been my friend, she's helped me to realise who I truly was, she was there for me when nobody else could be, she's been my girlfriend, the woman I love, and hopefully one day something more. An innocuous conversation led me down a path of self discovery and true love and I couldn't be happier at the way things have worked out ü•∞",
