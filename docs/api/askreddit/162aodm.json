They will probably try to manipulate or blackmail me into staying, but my friends and boyfriend are all rooting for me. If it wasn't for my best friend \u0026amp; boyfriend, I would've given up already. \nBtw, I know a lot of edgy teens throw around the word \"fascist\". (This is According to my parents though, so maybe it's not true.) I am not saying this lightly. I am trans \u0026amp; gay, my boyfriend is too. My parents think transgenderism is fake and everyone who claims to be trans is a danger to the public and shouldn't exist / have human rights. They also believe all trans and gay people are going to hell. \nI almost killed myself when I came out to them many years ago because the mental abuse got so bad \u0026amp; they cut me off from 95% of social interaction for two or so years. I am severely delayed in terms of social maturity and have developed serious attachment issues (mostly) because of this. I had to play into the rhetoric of \"it is your mental illness and you're just going through a phase\", and essentially walk myself back into the closet. At least I can somewhat talk freely to ppl now, so long as my parents are not nearby\n\nI'm scared, to be honest. They've raised me to think I can't survive without them. It's only thanks to my teacher that I realized it was a lie, she was also abused as a child and has been supporting me so much. Incase you're wondering why she didn't make any reports, my family has been investigated more than once but I wasn't safe to talk freely.

Then as he was choking me, I saw my vision start to narrow and I realized, this guy might kill me, accidentally or accidentally on purpose.\n\n\n2. Years later my buddy Pete and I were driving in a dust storm.  We slowed way down because we couldn't even see the end of the hood of the car.  We turned off the road because we didn't want to get hit by someone else, like a semi that was taller.  When the dust storm passed, we got out of the car and looked around, where is the road?  We apparently drove about a quarter mile off the road with rocks and trees and ravines.\n\n3. I was working on a radar antenna out in the dessert all by myself.  Nearest human was 10 miles away.  I had my arm inside an access panel when the software glitched and the thing spun around 360 in less than a second.  It could easily have ripped of my arm and I would have bled to death before anyone would have thought to check on me.\n\n4.  I took skydiving lessons and jumped out of a plane 5 times solo.\n\nSo now what is the biggest risk I have ever taken?\n\nI left my first wife, quit my job, and had no plan whatsoever.  She cleaned out the checking account and maxed out the credit card.  I had no car, she had caused me to alienate all my old friends.  I was not on speaking terms with my family.  So I go down to a homeless encampment.  The first night I am there, with all of my possessions in two garbage bags, the cops bust a homeless guy for something.  The rest of the camp is sure that I am an informant.  They have active discussions about what they are going to do to me.  It was the longest night of my life.
