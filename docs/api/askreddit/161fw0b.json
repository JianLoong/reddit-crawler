Our well-worn VHS of \"Star Trek: the Voyage Home\" was probably my most watched film as a child. Growing up I discovered the joy of simply hearing the man's voice, and later found out he did a few audiobooks. Later still, when I was going through a phase of reading celebrity autobiographies I found his (\"I Am Not Spock,\" and the follow-up: \"I Am Spock\") to be extremely insightful. His passion for both the dream of Star Trek itself, and the craft of acting in general were limitless. I was absolutely overjoyed to see him featured in a key role in \"Fringe,\" and when news of his passing came in 2015, I was literally in tears for a week.  \n\n\nAs an adult who received a later Autism diagnosis a lot of what I saw in Mr. Spock, and subsequently Nimoy himself made a lot more sense. See, I seldom if EVER \"identify\" with a fictional character, but Spock - to me at least was always more human than human.",

He was funny, self-deprecating, and I got to sit next to him as he played his new single.  Just him and an acoustic guitar.  After the show, he hung out for another half hour taking photos and signing autographs for the rest of the staff.  \n\nHe was - at least on that day - a very nice man, and when he died I felt very sad.",
