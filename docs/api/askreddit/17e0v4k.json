The temperature of the planet is increasing. We are having more and more extreme weather events everywhere on the planet. And AI is probably going to make 30% of the workforce obsolete within a few decades. Maybe 50%. More people. Fewer jobs. Less of the planet actually habitable.   \n\n\nWhy would I do that to a kid?",

Having a kid would come with sacrificing sleep and free time in order to see to the child's needs, and that doesn't sound enjoyable at all.\n\nSecond, children are pretty annoying. At worst, they're crying, screaming, and whining. Even if they're well-behaved, they still never shut up and need constant attention, which again isn't enjoyable. \n\nThird, they create logistical problems. My wife and I love being able to go places on a whim and vacation without worrying about how it impacts anyone else, and that becomes increasingly difficult when you have a baby or a toddler to contend with. Even something as simple as wanting to go out for dinner can come with logistical challenges when you have kids, and I don't wanna deal with it. \n\nFourth, I do not think that I'd be a good parent. I was held to a very high standard as a kid, and I think that I'd parent my child similarly and I honestly think I'd really struggle with having a child that didn't meet my expectations, and that wouldn't be good for either of us. \n\nFifth, I don't think it's fair to bring children into this fucked up world at this point. Anyone born at this point would have a very good chance of living to see climate disaster and some really hard times, and I question the morality of creating new life because of that.",
