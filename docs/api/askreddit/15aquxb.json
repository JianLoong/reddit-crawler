Generally, I'd say we want what most people want, love, sex, to be desired and respected, and we may fantasise about those things if we don't have them, or even if we do. I think more men fantasise about being the hero, though, like running into a burning building to save a kid or chasing off an attacker from a helpless lady. So maybe we fantasise more about protecting and helping, and being respected and admired through our actions more than women do.",
