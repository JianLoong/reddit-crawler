There’s appreciating returns on this, if there’s no time limit.\n\nAll I need to do is go to the grocery store and take an item out of a random dude’s cart, and suddenly I have $1,000 to broaden my scope.\n\nNow I can rent a super loud car for a day and drive it through a retirement community, boom a few extra thousand to play with. Maybe now I can afford to pay a guy to write #MAGA in the sky with his plane. This’ll piss off a lot of people, which will in turn piss off their opposition, and generate internet controversy.\n\nNow I’m viral. \n\nGo on YouTube and explain how it was all “just a prank bro!” And boom, the outrage machine is in full swing. Now all I have to do is sign up for Twitter and every now and then try to “justify” my actions, which will forever fuel the outrage machine, and boom. \n\nBillionaire in a month or less. \n\nGuaranteed",
