   "message": "Before my mom passed away she loved to tell the story about how much I loved chicken when I was a kid. Apparently I wouldn't eat anything else - they had to lie to me and tell me that other foods were chicken just to get me to eat it. \"this is chicken spaghetti!!\"     \n\nwhen she passed away I was in an airport. my flight was boarding. I was going to Bogota Colombia to take photos of the food and culture for a job. I had to shut down completely and just handle shit. Right there in the airport I planned her cremation, the funeral, travel plans for my sister, my travel plans, etc. Then I had to go do the job.     \n\nHer death didn't hit me until after the funeral. We all met up over at my grandmothers place - my grandmother opened the door and said \"come on in, we've got fried chicken!\" and I just broke down. Fell apart right there on the stairs.     \n\nI cant say that chicken is my favorite food these days - that would probably be a medium rare rib eye - but chicken was definitely my favorite when I was a kid. Chicken strips and chicken nuggets in particular.",

That was my favorite food and a food that I would really like to eat in large quantities until I was like 10 years old.\n\nI dont remember exactly when I started to really like other stuff but I didnt like McDonals or burgers in general, I much rather would have had an oatmeal.\n\nWhen I was 6 and we were on a trip through europe it was really hard to find food that I liked to eat. Once in Italy I was ordered a Spaghetti Bolognese which should be pretty normal meal. And I liked spaghetti somewhat but it tasted funny to me and I rejected it.\n\nDont know how I survived the trip or my first 10 years in life... But I bet, when we arrived home, my mom made porridge for me and that was the best meal I had for two weeks.\n\nBut I eventually stopped eating it. But now Im 35 and I have started enjoying a nice oatmeal again in the mornings with my 1 yo son.",
