A custard pie is a pie with a custard filling. If you top it with merengue and bake it, then it's a merengue pie. If you top if with whipped cream and chill it, it's a cream pie. Don't give me egg whites and tell me it's cream. \n\nMy mother argued with me about this once because she offered to bring me a slice of coconut cream which I love but instead brought coconut merengue which I hate (it was a nice offer but I'm not going to eat it). I ended up pulling out the 1984 Southern Living guide to pies (aka the bible) to show her the definitions after which point she agreed with me.
