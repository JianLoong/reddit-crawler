AC is a MUST in 110¬∞f days *but damn the cost* .\n\n\n 2nd would be ordering an expensive top-of-the-line 3D printer + various supplies to start my own business. I'm disabled \u0026amp; stay home mom \u0026amp; husband works a very low paying job, so we struggle constantly. I'm working with a case worker to help me sign up for disability payments but it's such a long process and any form of extra income would be a life saver right now. We're struggling for real.... just like everyone else pretty much.",
