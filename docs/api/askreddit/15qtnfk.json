Bakery lady had once worked with a woman who had gotten pregnant and named her daughter after her two favorite things. So she was a three-name person, like Tommy Lee Jones. According to the bakery lady at least. I scoffed and called bullshit, but she swore up and down this woman had this name.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nYears later, after I had left the job, I was on a website that featured names and photos of people who had recently graduated from a doctorate program. I can't even remember why the hell I was looking at the list, it was years and years ago.\n\n  \nAnywho, to make a story that didn't need to be this long just a wee bit longer, I scrolled down and there she was.
