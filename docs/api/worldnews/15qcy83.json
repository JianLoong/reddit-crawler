So 646 is a drop in the bucket and just a cost of doing business for traffickers.  \n\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (unodc), global production hit a record 1,982 tonnes in 2020. that is 1982000 kg.\n\nSo if we round to the nearest whole number, they removed 0% of the global cocaine supply.",
