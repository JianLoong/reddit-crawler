But you can't change the world, which makes it hopeless. And a major cause of depression is the (illusion of) inability to change things. \"Learned helplessness\" in a sense. All the psychological stresses are normalized to an extent that those who can't cope with this \"normality\" are considered pathological. It's really just powerful people shifting the normal curve and shitting on everybody who doesn't want to comply - or who can't comply - depressed people. They can't even change themselves for the better because some people aren't stress-tolerant enough or simply already have enough stress and can't deal with even more. It's not their fault.",

Also, mental health has become less of a taboo and we have the means to diagnose ppl much better, so stuff like autism and ADHD are now much more visible than ever before (despite some ppl claiming \"we didn't have autism in my day\"). So imo we are slowly seeing the effects of both this and the fact that more people seeking help for mental health issues, our current society puts on us",

The two working parent household became a necessary dynamic to \"keep up with the Jones'\" and live the American dream of 2.5 children, a house, a car and a dog.\n\nThe end result for children were severely disengaged parents that gave less attention to their kids, were less involved in their education, and allowed far more time for idle hands and frustrated introspection from teenagers.\n\nThe grim truth is that the standard of living has been gradually declining for households with children, and children feel the most effect from that. Capitalism's cancerous overreach is, imo, the root cause of so much suffering. The system is unsustainable, and we are approaching it's collapse.",

You get what you pay for therefore if you pay shit wages to teachers, you're going to get shit teachers.\n6. Ease of access for things that give instant gratification. Search what you want and instantly get it. This causes impatience if kids are given access too early. There was a study that showed the dangers of giving your young ones access to Cocomelon YouTube videos. It changes scene every single time in under 5 seconds.

   "message": "Lot of factors to list off a few if we cut out childhood traumas. \n\n- Access to information. It's not to say people didn't see or hear bad things on the news or the likes before. But now people can pick up their phone or just glance at a device and even if they're not intending to cancel see something horrible going on. Makes people feel hopeless when EVERYTHING seems like it's on fire and that you can't do anything. \n\n- Isolation/expectations. More so coming off of the pandemic shutdowns (yes even still), a lot of people are alone, sometimes minimal or no contact with no idea how to. Coupled with the expectation that you should be married, have kids, and be surrounded by friends it can be crippling to some of even one of those are missing (and for many all of them are). \n\n- Work life balance and general work life. People work A LOT and very few people actually like their job, even in a field they want to be in. It also just eats a lot of time, so even when you get a break, suddenly you're doing errands for half a free day and realize you haven't had a moment to yourself. Couple all of that with jobs across the board being more demanding it's easy to get lost in a cycle of another day going by with brief snaps that months or years went by and you've not enjoy most of that time. \n\n- Realization of getting older/getting trapped in the past. Kind of couples with expectations of yourself, but getting hung up on what you haven't done and what's past rather than on what there is to accomplish. Although it's not always to say people don't get depressed looking forward either, by setting sky high goals they feel they can't reach, or negative events happening like the loss of a family member/someone close. \n\n- Getting stuck in the headspace. When you're sad/depressed you often compound by connecting to other moments or sadness or depression, wh re good memories often feel lackluster or far and few between. It's important to get out of the headspace, pick out something that was good every day and build the habit to think on the positives when you can. Even small stuff like \"what I had for dinner tasted good\" or \" I heard something funny\".\n\nAlso as a big ending note to this list. I know it can seem depressing and believe me I deal with my own dark places often. However you have to keep moving on, look on the bright side when you can, and just set achievable goals, even something small and easy for yourself and strive to achieve them.",

We need to stop putting the weigh of the world on our teens, too. I know why I first developed depression, because I was physically and emotionally abused at home and school, and depressed became the baseline for my experience in life. It didn't help that when the abuse lowered and eventually dissapeared, I was still being crushed by incressingly demanding academical challenges and constantly hearing about how teenage me needed to know what to study or risk messing up her whole life.\n\nI have only been happy when giving and being surrounded by love, that is my reason to live. Whether I use my degree a lot or end up working somewhere else doesn't matter that much to me anymore. I just want to be able to cultivate meaningful relationships, to offer myself to someone who loves me, and to surround myself in precious friendships. However I pay for that is not that important.\n\nThing is, I am particularly privileged to have the chance to notice that. I've finished studying and work few hours while I heal from burnout and a rough patch in my life. Most people don't get this break, they go from depressed teens to depressed adults studying and then slaving away at work.\n\nEducation is super important, but how we educate is the most important aspect of it. Right now, very few places have it right. We treat young people as if they were workers because we have to \"prepare\" them for the real world. Kids being handed punishments and hours of homework and told to attend school and then keep studying at home so they can compete with all the other depressed kids.\n\nThis is bullshit in my honest opinion. Why prepare people for a shitty world when we should be inspiring them to make it better?

Here in the UK kids hardly ever 'hang' outside any more. I live in a village with 1000 souls and the only times I see teenagers on the road is when the school bus comes back. I don't see them playing football in the park or kissing under the trees or anything like that. That is purely anecdotal, but there are clear indicators that being in full daylight is beneficial to your mental health as well as being 'active' in terms of exercise. \n\nThe other thing that is increasingly under the spotlight is (ultra) processed food. We live in an age where the food we eat is so artificial (because it's more 'convenient') that our gut flora has changed dramatically. The link between a healthy gut flora and mental wellbeing is being demonstrated more strongly in science and progress in this area makes it seem inevitable that healthier eating (and drinking) contributes to better wellbeing.",
