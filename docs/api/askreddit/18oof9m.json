   "message": "Lots of people have joints that crack, but my right ankle would make a noise so loud it echoed off walls. It didn't take any special effort to crack that loudly either: just sit for a few minutes, shift absentmindedly, and BANG. There was no real way to prevent it; delaying just made things louder.\n\nPeople often mistook that sound for the building settling. Was glad of that mistake because otherwise it would have been embarrassing. The few individuals who figured out the source assumed I must have had massive ankle problems.\n\nExcept I've never had an ankle injury of any sort. Never even twisted it. Nature gave me strong tree-trunk-like ankles.\n\nA few months ago it stopped. Decades of shattering noise, then silence. I have no idea why.",
