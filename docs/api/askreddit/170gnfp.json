   "message": "Merchant Sailor here for about 11 years now. Have been to plenty of countries with a coast and a ship port.\n\nThere are a couple countries that I think stand out. Ireland and New Zealand takes the cake for picturesque green fields and ranges. Norway for their unbelievably gorgeous fjords. But I really love Japan!\n\nThere's a mysterious beauty to Japan. Of course, tourists only go to see Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, etc. But in other provincial/rural prefectures you get to see so much more. There are small towns up in the mountains connected by railroads where their culture really resides. And seriously, the people are really nice, well, the ones I met were.\n\nThere was one time we were taking out a newly built ship and had to stay at a hotel for 2 weeks while the yard was finishing up. When we had to move to the ship, I left some stuff at my room, like Japanese coins that I know I wouldn't use anymore, a speaker that only works on 110v that was already busted, and a couple of work clothes. We were still tied up to the berth though. Next morning, I see the cleaning lady, who barely spoke any english, coming up to the ship with bags. Turns out they collected everything from our rooms, and wanted to return in to us, even money. In addition to that, she gives us small japanese cakes, with a note from the staff, telling us to always stay safe and that they enjoyed our stay with them.\n\nSo I'll go with Japan, for their culture and people.",
