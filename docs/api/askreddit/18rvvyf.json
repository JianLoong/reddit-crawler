I want to be able to stand tall and be absolutely certain that I am going to be okay. Not just for the moment, but for the future too.  \n\n\nIt's all just too much. So much, in fact, that I feel that the only way to cope is to become heartless. To be devoid of emotion.   \n\n\nI just want to sleep, man. It's all I want.",
