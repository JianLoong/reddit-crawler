Not someone from a call center outsourced to another country or an automated menu, but an actual employee who cared about getting the job right because they wanted to get vested in the company's pension plan. (Yes, pensions were still a thing).\n\nThe person who picked up the phone would either know the answer to your question, transfer you to someone who did, or take a message. There was no voice mail hell. You might get put on hold, but in that case the standard business courtesy was to check in with the caller every two minutes with a status update and see whether the caller wanted to continue waiting. There was no sales pitch during the hold, no crappy automated recording claiming your call is important. Just straight to the point service. And you wouldn't get routed to the sales department if you wanted to cancel something.",
