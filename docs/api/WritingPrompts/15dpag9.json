   "message": "[Poem]\n\nIf you find an abandoned bike,\n\nDon't ring it's bell,\n\nIt calls an attractive \u0026amp; weary paperboy,\n\nFrom deep within hell,\n\nOnce you see his devilish grin,\n\nYou're under his spell,\n\nHe'll fall dramatically down,\n\nAnd give a loud yell,\n\nHe'll hold his foot and lie,\n\n\"I stepped on a nail,\"\n\nYou cannot resist offering to cover his shift,\n\nHis charms will compel,\n\nYou will put on his hat \u0026amp; hop on his bike,\n\nAnd he will bid you farewell,\n\nYou'll pedal without direction,\n\nFirst you'll notice the smell,\n\nThen you'll find yourself far far ... far below,\n\nWhere the horned ones dwell,\n\nThe job is rigged and try as you might,\n\nYou will almost always fail,\n\nWith pay depending on the papers delivered,\n\nYou can barely afford a motel,\n\nYou'll want to go back but not know how,\n\nIt's something the paperboy didn't tell.\n\n\n°°°°°°°°°°\n\nI know I know, you're sad and miserable. After all, who wants to be stuck delivering mail? But fear not, if you want to escape then it's your despair you must quell. I can get you out for a *small fee,* it's a secret I can afford to sell. \n\nYes! Yours and the next! That'll do! Take this!\n\n... What? Don't give me that look! What you hold is no ordinary snail! Use its slime and rub it all up in your hair, it serves as a quite charismatic gel. \n\nNow slurp out the bugger and chew him good, what remains should be only the shell. This next step, be warned, stay on your bike and when the path opens, you'd better be ready to propel. Until that moment comes, keep your lips sealed and the shell to your ear. Listen for the sound of a bell.",
