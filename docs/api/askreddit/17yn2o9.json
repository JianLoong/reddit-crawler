   "message": "Everything I‚Äôm saying here is what I would feel if I did shoplift **hypothetically**. Shoplifting is highly immoral, and I feel utmost contempt for all shoplifters.\n\n1. It‚Äôs a victimlessless crime. A lot of the crap you hear about it raising prices of good and losing employee wages isn‚Äôt true. Companies track what they call ‚Äúshrink‚Äù and they already know how much they‚Äôre going to lose before the year even starts. The billionaires that own Walmart can afford to pay their employees more, they just choose not to, that choice is not on me.\n\n2. I just can, *you* just can. Once you get away with it and realize most of time, no one is coming for you, you start questioning why you paid for stuff to begin with. I feel far more guilty about spending money than I do shoplifting. To me, spending money is the deviant action in my mind. I know someone that walked into a store and stole a single $600 item and walked out and nothing happened to him.\n\n3. The thrill. The research and planning the theft is almost addictive, I go in, check their cameras, check what their loss prevention is like, see if they have an EAS (electronic article surveillance) gate, if they have RFID (radio frequency identification) tags. Then when I actually conceal the stuff and exit the store, the dopamine hit I get is pure bliss.\n\n4. The ego aspect. There is something kind of narcissistic about it. Like I look around at all the dumb people who‚Äôve bought into the system. They wouldn‚Äôt even think to take something and walk out with it because there minds are so limited to what the big businesses tell them. Largely it isn‚Äôt true, but the large scale compliance even under the dystopian circumstances in America scares me. I‚Äôm far more afraid of being a ‚Äúfree‚Äù drone than any jail cell. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt sound too neurotic lol.\n\n5. Also me and my family are struggling financially.\n\nI hope someone finds this interesting to read.",
