Once you've pushed it back a bit, there are many techniques you can use to stave it off again. All the classics: get outdoors, go buy some healthy food, exercise, clean up your kitchen, get a haircut, whatever works for you. Just keep throwing shit at that wall so it doesn't close in on you again.  \n\nI started keeping a record of what works and what doesn't. If something works, I try to keep it up. Writing it down every day (after I do it) works for me as a reminder. And the best thing is that the things that work for you feed upon themselves when you do them. They give you more energy to keep it going, they spread seeds like plants in a garden.  \n\nIt's not all good days, but treating it like a chronic condition *and actually treating it*, is what helps me.",

I had nowhere to go so I lived in my car for 3 months until I managed to save some money to rent a cheap place and start over (was lucky to have a job where I could shower and had a microwave where I could heat up ready meals from the supermarket). \n\nYoga and gym kept me going for a while, together with keeping myself busy at work (took a lot of side projects in the company on purpose so I would not have time to think about anything else), but after finding a place to live I succumbed into alcohol, weed and some other drugs. \n\nThe way I see it looking back now is like when you go to the beach and seat under the sun for hours, when you go back home you kind of think \"oh, im not really burned actually\", but only later when you have a shower and go to bed you realize how much sunburn you got. \n\nI ended up leaving the country and starting fresh, gave up on drinking and all drugs, and for me the most important:\n\nKickboxing, 5 times a week, 2 hours sessions. That is what keeps my depression away while helps me connect with people and reward my body and my mind for the hard work. I feel sometimes the depression lingering when facing some sad times in life, like we all do, but I found out that exercising and keeping myself busy with small projects its the most effective way to combat what I believe to be a very serious illness. \n\nI try to give myself a fighting chance with a more or less decent diet (some junk food every now and then makes me happy too), exercise, social connection and whenever I can, some sun. Also, I have my own concept of who God is and how much He loves us, so I guess that faith helps me above all as well. \n\nFor anyone going through hard times and is reading this, I hope you know that, one day after the other, little by little, things will get better. So don't give up. Im now 32yo, and for the most part, I believe I am quite happy. \n\nA little last advice: I learned that our mind is the most powerful thing, so be careful with what you put inside it. What you read, watch and listen to, this can all play a very positive or negative effect in your life. Much love to everyone, stay bless : )",
