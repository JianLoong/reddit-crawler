Most investments managed by a broker or pension are classed as 'Utility' and 'Real Estate' and other vague classifications that would make it difficult for anyone to identify what specific companies they were invested in. Fidelity/Charles/Plus500/Hargreaves all operate this way.\n\nWhat's concerning is that A) the threshold for declaration is £70k (2x the average household income for a year), B) What if the value is below the threshold on appointment and grows in the time due to their decisions - do they have to update annually? C) The article indicates her shares were \"Over £70k\" - which is just the threshold i.e it could be £7m for all the Beeb knows.",
