A branch ripped it wide open and to the bone, I had fat and muscle falling out, and I very nearly bled to death. It took hours of surgery and months spent mostly in bed before I was able to really use that leg again. It's been more than twenty-five years since then and the scar is still massive (half an inch wide and wraps all the way around my inner thigh).\n\nThat fall was only three feet. #1 reason for why I frequently tell people to never underestimate a fall, even a short one. It only takes one accident to completely fuck you up and potentially kill you, so caution is important.",

I slipped on some shampoo residue in a rush to get out of the shower (because no likey cold air). I slammed my ribs against the porcelain tub. Completely knocked the wind out of me, but I somehow managed to crawl out of the shower and bathroom to make it to my phone, genuinely thinking I would have to call an ambulance to take my naked ass to the hospital.\n\nThankfully that wasn‚Äôt necessary as I laid down and caught my breath, but I had pretty bad rib pain for at least a month after (and only a TINY bruise to show for it!). After that experience I could absolutely see how falling in the shower can kill a person.\n\nAnyway, now I don‚Äôt rush when exiting the shower and I always bring my phone in the bathroom because that naked, wet crawl on the floor to retrieve it was humiliating and I‚Äôd rather not go through it again.",

The rooster had spurs on his legs over an inch long and he cut big grooves on my brother's face, missing his eyes by millimeters. They swarmed him and bullied him until he dropped the chick and ran out of the coop crying with blood on his face. \n\nHe was 10 at the time and should have known better.

   "message": "Precipitation when it is cold outside.  \n\nI got caught in a snowstorm in Shenandoah National Park in March, 2019.  It was 50 in the valley, but I got 2 feet of snow on the top of the ridge.  The forecast did not call for any precipitation that day.  I was hiking on the Appalachian Trail and thought that a few flurries were nothing to worry about.  I left a lean-to shelter that would have kept me dry and protected from the wind.  I hiked less than 6 miles and was struggling to move forward because the snow was so deep.  I was soaked to the bone, freezing cold, and beginning to lose fine muscle control in my fingers.  The trail followed the side of a ridge and was not providing me any flat spaces to set up a tent.  I eventually found a clearing where some power lines crossed the trail and struggled to get my tent erected despite the loss of feeling in my fingers.  Once my tent was set up, I got my sleeping pad and sleeping bag deployed, got out of my wet clothes and crawled into the bag for an hour to warm up.  \n\nI didn't even have a cell signal where I could let someone know my exact location and that I was ok.  I had been in contact the previous evening, so my girlfriend knew my location to within a couple of miles.\n\nThe snowstorm lasted all night and I had to spend a full 24 hours in the tent before the snow stopped.  The next day after the snow stopped, I packed up my camp and kept hiking through the 2 feet of snow.  The trail crossed Skyline Drive after a short distance and I followed that road for \\~9 miles to the nearest park entrance.  I called a shuttle and spent the night in Waynesboro, VA at a hiker hostel.  The warm shower, boot dryer, and warm food were exquisite.\n\nWhen you make an error in judgement in the wilderness, the goal is to survive long enough to learn from your mistake.  I learned my lesson.  I will not screw around when dealing with precipitation and cold weather.  If there is any doubt, I will just hunker down and wait for the wet weather to pass.",

The snake made a run for it rather than bite, and that is why I was not bit. So what is my point? You cannot see these things. You look at pictures of them and think \"yeah I would be able to see that, right on the ground in front of me.\" Yeah, no. That 6 inch close call was after I inspected the area closely before pulling weeds. Could not see him, he was right there. This particular snake freezes when threatened and that is the other problem. I almost have stepped on one twice. Once again in the middle of the day I am walking in the dried grass, look to my left, there is a huge copperhead. Could not see it till I was right on it. Fortunately I was 3 feet away when I spotted him. He was right there, in the open just curled up, could not see him till 3 feet away. Now I have to wear snake boots when in my yard because sooner or later, I am going to step on one. They will bite at the ankle, foot or lower leg, so got all that covered in thick boots.",
