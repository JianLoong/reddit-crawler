   "message": "I didn't quite understand the concept of saving money when I was younger. I had a decent paying job for my age with very few expenses, so I had a lot of spare cash. Because of that, I spent a lot of money. Eating out every other night. Trips to theme parks every other week. Buying expensive gadgets all the time. I never really checked my bank account, I just always had money in there (I wasn't rich, I just hovered at around $1K. Money would go in, then money would come out).\n\nOne day, I was putting fuel in my car and my card got rejected. I checked my bank, it was -$10.\n\nAs I said, I had no concept of saving money, so it's not like I had different accounts I could just transfer money from. I had literally negative money overall. My spending just got away from me, and I had nothing left until I got paid again.\n\nWorst still, I had a university course I had to pay for, which isn't cheap. For the next two months, I survived on about two hot dogs a day. One for breakfast, one for dinner. I didn't each lunch, nor did I snack. Literally just two frankfurters and two slices of bread a day.\n\nBudget frankfurters were dirt cheap, as was bread. The first month was to save money for my uni bill, the next month was to get my money back up. After that, I learned to save instead of spend.",
