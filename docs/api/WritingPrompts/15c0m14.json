   "message": "It was found in a baron's wine cellar. It was surrounded by, \"Overpriced swill,  impressive only to those who had never tasted it. And none properly stored.\"\n\nWhen the baron died, the royal wizard was sent to check for curses. He declared \"Liar's Wine\" a Cursed Artifact.  Then he left.\n\nI'll offer a brief digression to mention that when a Cursed Artifact is found, it isn't collected. None but the true Owner can use such an artifact safely. Actually taking such an artifact is a great way to attract the Owner's attention. And while few wizards could match the royal wizard in a fair duel, holding onto someone else's artifact would make for a quite unfair duel--and not in the royal wizard's favor.\n\nSo, the royal wizard merely left behind a ward strong enough to deter any accidental visits yet weak enough that the Owner would not be offended.\n\nThis was quite convenient for me, the owner. A competent ward could easily have kept me out. So, I walked into the baron's estate. Unnamed guard posts and open gates did nothing to bar entry.\n\nA sip of tasty Liar's Wine to celebrate and here I am. Still, it's a bit boring, here in the wine cellar. I'll gladly welcome you to join me for a sip of wine.",
