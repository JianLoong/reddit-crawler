   "message": "I was 18, freshly out of high school and got a job at a newly opened pizza place. The crew was all younger kids around my age, I quickly befriended another girl working there but there was a guy, maybe a year or two older than me, who just gave me the weirdest vibes. I just felt uncomfortable being around him. He didn't really do anything outright strange, he hit on me and kept asking for my number, but I had a boyfriend (now my husband) and kept turning this guy down, he was never rude or about it or anything, so I had no real reason to feel anything was off about him, but I did.\n\nSometimes while I was working, I'd feel like someone was staring at me and I'd turn around and he'd be watching me from the other side of the kitchen. I remember telling the girl I had befriended that I just felt something was *off* about that guy and he made my skin crawl. Another coworker, who had gone to school with the guy, overheard the conversation and told me that he understood, his friend could be intense and off-putting but he was mostly harmless. The other girl and I just kind of tried to laugh it off but she agreed that something just didn't feel right. \n\nI always worked the late shift, so I could start after my college classes and I worked until close, one night the creepy guy got off work maybe an hour or two before close and I was scheduled to close. So he leaves at his scheduled time, and I work until close and then go to leave and walk to my car. It was around 1:00AM at this time and super dark, as I'm walking to my car I notice someone else in the parking lot, it was the creepy guy and he was just... standing there. Watching me. His car was still there so he wasn't waiting for a ride, he had just waited for me to leave. I got in my car and felt just incredibly weirded out by the entire thing so I left, went home to my apartment, told my partner what happened and then sent my manager a text and said I was sorry, but the creepy guy was making me uncomfortable to the point that I couldn't work there anymore and that had been my last night. I never went back.\n\nAbout a month later, I see on the news that the creepy guy from the pizza place had followed the other girl from work, the one I had been friends with, one night after a closing shift. He had waited outside her house in the dark, broke in when everyone was asleep, murdered her dad, and held her hostage/assaulted her for hours while the police and swat team tried to get him out of the house. \n\nI still think about her a lot, and at the time I felt genuinely guilty about what happened to her, as if I could have done something to prevent it.",

   "message": "Back when I was 18/19, I had taken a couple of days off work due to feeling very flu/cold-like. I was laying in my bed feeling out of it, very groggy, sleepy, and weirdly, confused. I also had weird, sharp, jabbing pains in my gut when I woke up.\n\nIt was the middle of the afternoon, Mom was at work, Dad at work, and sister at school. Then, shortly, I heard my Dad come home (my bedroom window was above the garage).\n\nThen suddenly, I felt this super-intense, deep-seated feeling of impending doom. Like, if feelings were put into words, \"Omg, OMG! ***OMG!!!*** Get to the hospital!!! *NOW! NOW! NOW!*\" \n\nI've never, ever felt such an unreal sense of urgency and much less to a hospital. It scared me, but I listened to myself and called shakily out for my Dad downstairs to please come up quick.\n\nYou do not tell my Dad what to do, even if it's important.  I heard him puttering downstairs, so I yelled again, louder, \"Dad! Please, come here, quick!\" He yelled something back, like, \"Hold on. I'm busy.\"\n\nA couple more minutes, this terrible, urgent feeling is only getting worse. \"DAD!!!\" \n\nHe comes bursting up the stairs yelling for me to \"Shut up, stop yelling in the house! I just got home! I don't need you yelling and screaming in the house! The whole damned neighborhood can hear you scream!\"\n\nNormally, I would shut right up, but not this time. I interrupted him and told him in a scared, loud voice, \"Please, take me to the hospital! Now!\"\n\nHe looked at me and said, \"Why? What's wrong? I'm not going anywhere, I just got home. Your Mom will be home, she can take you.\" He turns to go into the master bedroom. \n\n\"DAD! I don't know what's wrong, but you HAVE TO TAKE ME, NOW! PLEASE!\"\n\nHe sees my scared face, \"Well, you're not going *anywhere* until you get into that shower.\"\n\nI jumped in, took the quickest shower ever, and urged him to get in the truck and go.\n\nMy sister came home from school, and she took her time grabbing what she wanted to take with her, and we finally got into the truck and left.\n\nOn the way there, he said he may as well stop at the university photographic history for photos he's had on order on the way to the hospital.  (!!!)\n\nAt this point, I'm fading. I'm in my seat belt all shlumped forward, I don't remember too much. Dad was inside the building, for I think about 15, 20 minutes. Sister kept asking if I was alright. She was worried.\n\nFinally, he comes back in the truck and starts to show us the photos of the old west in our town. I perked up enough to tell him, \"I don't think I'm going to make it.\" That lit a fire under his butt, I think it was because he saw how pale I was.\n\nHe ended up taking me to this tiny, dinky urgent care facility in an old small strip mall, thinking it wouldn't cost as much as a hospital emergency room.\n\nUrgent care staff took one look at me and told him either they call the ambulance or he fast-tracks it to the ER ASAP. He *finally* got how serious it was. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThere was a bottleneck at the OR (busy, crowded), and they got me right in for exploratory surgery. The next morning, my surgeon told me that had I been just 35, 45 minutes longer, I wouldn't be in bed right now.\n\nMy appendix had burst hours earlier, lilely while I was asleep, and I was in the advanced stages of deterioration/bacterial infestation (whatever it's called). I had to spend 12 days in isolation in the I.C.U.\n\nIf I hadn't felt that \"impending doom\" and acted upon it, I wouldn't be here.",

A man on a bike circled us a couple of times on the playground, then stopped, dropped his sweats, and started asking us questions as he jacked off. I didn't even think of protecting myself, I was thinking about how to get my younger sibling out of there and away from this fucking pervert. By instinct I politely answered a couple of questions as I took sibling's hand \u0026amp; backed away. He was too busy jackin' it to follow us, fortunately (?). When we got around the corner of the school building I told sibling to \"RUN, we're going home,\" and half-dragged them back to our house. I kept looking back to make sure he wasn't following us because it was just so obvious this guy was sick and dangerous, targeting young girls like that. \n\nI was 11. Sibling was about 8. Turns out this guy had been going around the neighborhood doing this to other girls around our age, the cops had him on their radar and it wasn't until he actually assaulted a girl that they were able to arrest him. \n\nI don't know what he might've done to us other than flashing us, but 11-year-old me wasn't planning on sticking around to find out.

   "message": "Went on a class trip to Latvia, Riga in my last year of high school. I was year older than the rest cause I was a fuckhead who took a year off to do dumb shit with friends at the time. Several of my friends got in to trouble for various petty crime stuff while I tended to avoid it or leave before things got too heated. \n         Now back to the trip. We met some students from another school who talked about a club where we all could meet and party. While looking for this spot we met three locals who said they knew the place and that we should follow them. It was me, 3 girls and a guy from the class at the time. I noticed that the street they took us down had almost no Street lights and many of the buildings were halfbroken/burnt/deserted. Also noticed that the third guy was now way behind us. Looking side-to-side at the main street we came from. Scouting to see if others saw us walking in. He turned towards me and he looked started for me noticing. Then I heard the front guy say. It's in the basement of this warehouse. There was no people, no sound, no nothing. I shouted to my friends in Norwegian that these guys were trying to set us up too no good. Rob us or something. They instantly ran back with me to the street all while we heard the guys running after us and shouting obsceneties. The one with best English screamed \"Typical rich Norwegians. You come here to our country to party and take what's ours fuck you!\"\n\nThe day after we heard that one of the students looking for the same club from the other school got kidnapped near that street. They took him to the forrest, ripped off his clothes and beat him up in the snow. Took him to an atm and had him withdraw the little cash he had. Beat him again cause they thought he was rich and had more. He was found naked in the curb near the hotel he slept at. They threw him out of the car while speeding by.\n\nI like to think that the little street smarts I learned from hanging with the wrong crowd taught me to be wary of certain body language and vibes that certain people give off. Who knows what would have happened to us if we went inside that basement with those wackos.",

He muttered ‚Äúyes ma‚Äôam‚Äù and scuttled off. \nAlso not thinking, I picked up a bbq knife that happened to be right there, went through the house to the front windows and saw him crouched by my car in the driveway. I called the cops, they arrived, we discovered that someone - probably the same dude - had just broken into our neighbour‚Äôs house and stolen a gun. \nThe cops gave me a condescending talking to about the ‚Äòrisks‚Äô of confronting a criminal but I am convinced to this day that my instincts saved me from a life altering and horrible experience.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up and something in my head was like, something isn't right, gtfo of here. So I called out \"Hey there\" in a friendly tone - dead silence, he said nothing back. I turned around and ran as fast as I could.  I only looked back once to see this guy was in a full out sprint after me. As soon as I got out of the tunnel I started screaming for help and turned up an embankment that I knew led to the closest house. And I just kept running until I stumbled in their front door.
