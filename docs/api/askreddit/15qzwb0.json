So, I also felt totally guilty bc I thought I was wasting her money, as well. I'm pretty sure I cried in that situation. \n\nAnd to this day, I'm so super conscious about wasting food and money, and often settle for something even if it's not really what I wanted.\n\nSo yeah, The Cheesecake Factory's food was so shit it traumatized me.",
