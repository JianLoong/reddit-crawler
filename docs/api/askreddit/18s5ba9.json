   "message": "I quit drinking like ten years ago, but I always enjoyed going out for drinks with my dad.  He's always been enjoyable to hang out with and he usually has some pretty funny stories to tell over a few beers.  \n\nBack when I was in my 20's and went out with my friends a lot, we often invited my dad along to party with us.  Everyone called him dad and he was often the life of the party.",
