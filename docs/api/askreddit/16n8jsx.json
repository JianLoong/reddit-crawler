One of them worked there, and they planned to stage a fake robbery; the other two being the robbers and ‚Äúforcing‚Äù him to open the safe and registers. An off-work employee stopped by randomly while this was happening and one of the ‚Äúrobbers‚Äù shot him \u0026gt;!in front of his 2 year old son!\u0026lt; with the very real gun.\n\nThe shooter was in my psychology class, and in my desk pod (the classroom was arranged in groups of 4 desks pushed together). Let‚Äôs call him S. All week our teacher would make sure we were all doing okay‚Äî this happened in the strip mall closest to our high school so dozens of juniors and seniors worked in the varying businesses there. S would make these comments like ‚Äúdamn, I hope they get him‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs scary, so close to home‚Ä¶.‚Äù One day, maybe that same week even, the police came to the school and I‚Äôll never forget how I felt in this moment ‚Äî S was called to the office during our class and he just stood up, gathered his backpack and book, smiled at us all, and said something like ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs that,‚Äù or ‚Äúabout time‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs been good, y‚Äôall‚Äù something that hinted at admission.\n\nPretty sure I remember they canceled a bunch of games; the joke in town was ‚ÄúOooh don‚Äôt play ______ High, they have a killer football team!‚Äù\n\nThe trial was a whole debacle because there were other students - other football players - peripherally involved‚Ä¶ like how they got the gun from another varsity football player (not present during the shooting) who worked at a sporting goods store and had stolen it from their boss. All three were found guilty ‚Äî mainly because they used a school logo football bag during the robbery and then dumped the empty bag in the park between the school and the strip mall ‚Äî and got varying sentences. I think S was tried as an adult and might still be in prison.\n\nIf this story sounds familiar to you, *go Cougars* amirite\n\nEdit to update: just looked him up on socmed ‚Äî ***OMG he‚Äôs out***",

Not just a sip, kids would show up drunk\n- my high school had one of the worst drug problems in the state so I feel like everything was drug related. \n- the occasional student car would get stolen \n- what was casual groping in the 80‚Äôs is actually sexual assault. \n- rumors of teachers and students hooking up. \n- oh, not actually in the school, but a few parents were busted for insider trading in 1987 / black Monday \n- lots of kids beating the shit out of other kids was just brushed off as bullying and now would be assault\n- lots of kids under 18 dated people in their 20‚Äôs.
