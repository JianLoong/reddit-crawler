 "selftext": "I used to live in Melbourne about a decade ago and recently returned for a holiday. Here are a few notes from my trip.\n\n- My favorite coffee place closed down.\n- I found a new favorite coffee place (not hard)\n- While there were more homeless and druggies in the city then I remember, it was not as bad as Reddit would have me believe.\n- The Tan is still awesome\n- Free tram travel in the city is fantastic.\n- Public transport much better than where I am from in the US. Granted that is not saying much.\n- Melbourne people are very sociable and friendly.\n- Still so much great food in Melbourne from simple snacks to lunches and dinners. People don’t realize how lucky they are.\n- That being said not impressed with the new Chinatown. Back in the day when the mafia owned most of the restaurants it was easy to get a good traditional dish like Bitter Melon and Beef. Now you have hot pot, dumplings, roast pork, and bbq pork. Lame.\n- Economy doing well. People were out in force every night of the week.\n- People smoke and vape WAY too much here. In case you haven’t heard that’s not good for you.\n- Australian red wine is awesome. Not sure why it’s not that available in the US beyond a few brands.\n- Australian Netflix is way better compared to US version. Elite.\n- Blue PK gum is no longer available. A travesty.\n- Karl has gained weight\n- Matildas are awesome!\n\nThat’s all I can think of. Thank you Melbourne. I’ll make sure I return before 10 years next time.",
