That would eliminate so many problems: homes, health care, education, food would all be super accessible and costs would go up on a sliding scale based on how necessary a good or service is.  So, things like transportation, recreation, culture would be in another tier and it would go up until the highest costs would be for the most useless goods, like cheap\nplastic Dollar Store trinkets. They would cost so much that they wouldn’t exist and that would help solve ecological problems.  \n\nBasically a whole new structure for all economics based on what we’ve learned from it being created organically throughout civilisation.  Obviously, supply and demand would still play a role and prices couldn’t be arbitrarily given, but life shouldn’t cost so much.  We’re at a point in civilization where all people should have access to all needs.  The only thing stopping that from happening is corruption and greed, i.e. costs.",
