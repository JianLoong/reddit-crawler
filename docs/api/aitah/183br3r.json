 "selftext": "I won’t get into details on how long or why i started going to the gym. although my recent lady friend and i started talking a lot, she seemed super kind and i honestly hoped she was a good person.\n\nyesterday while we were at the gym, she asked me a spicy question about what my husband and i do together in bed? i was honestly embarrassed at first but she kept teasing and claiming \"it can’t be that bad\"\n\nI told her my husband and i like to do things differently, he takes the submissive role and i the dominant, sometimes making him crossdressing with his consent or wear cute women lingerie. she then proceeded to snap at me and told me that it was disgusting and asked me if he’s forcing me to do that.  i told her that i actually love it and she proceeded to tell me that i shouldn’t or that \"i’m delusional\" and other online terms i had to look up like \"he’s a femboy\" or \"a manlit\"\n\nEdit: Yes, i asked my husband years prior if it’s okay if we talk about our sex life, he said yes.\n\ndouble edit: **(To the man who told me he wants to slut out my husband in dms and telling me vulgar things, please leave me alone and may god help you find yourself)**",
