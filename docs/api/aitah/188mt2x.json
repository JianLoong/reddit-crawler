 "selftext": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/M7cafqtAgC)\n\nSince so many people took interest last time I figured I'd update you all.\n\nSo about a week after I posted my original post, my ex gf dropped by my place.\n\nShe said that she wanted to get back together, and that it was silly of us to break up over this.\n\nI told her that I'm just not comfortable with her friendship with B.\n\nShe said that her cheating with B was a mistake. But that was in the past, and she's grown.\n\nI told her that it doesn't really look like it, she goes out drinking with B very often, and you two were fucking after you and your ex broke up. ( They were fwb before AND after her ex).\n\nI told her I'm just not taking a chance to be her next sucker.\n\nShe then said \"What if I cut off B? Can we get back together then?\"\n\nI was tempted for a second tbh. Our relationship seemed great. But I remembered some of the comments I read in my last post, and I asked her\n\n\"Have you been fucking B since we broke up?\"\n\nI had never seen such a poor poker face. \n\nShe stumbled her words, and said no.\n\nI gave her a look like \"That's b.s.\"\n\nShe saw this and said \"I mean, we were broken up...\"\n\nI just put my hands up, and said \"Nope\"\n\nI then asked her to leave.\n\nShe was really upset.",
