   "message": "I've always wanted an extra fluffy petticoat, ever since I was a little girl, and I am now 40. Back then, I didn't even know what it was called, so I called it a poof-out skirt, lol.\n\nFor the uninitiated, a petticoat is a multi-layer skirt you wear under dresses to give the bottom half of the dress more volume. Think back to the 50s, the days of the poodle skirt, or Gone With The Wind.\n\nThat dream never died. And as the years passed, my petticoat dreams became more specific. I wanted it made of chiffon and satin, not tulle. And I wanted it to be tea-length, or about down to my shins. And I wanted it to be cherry red, so that I could wear it with a black dress and pay homage to Christian Louboutin, a French luxury shoe designer whose classic shoe is black with a red sole. \n\nSo at one point, as an adult, I began my search for the perfect petticoat. I scoured the internet, and looked around on different sites. I knew Amazon and Walmart weren't going to have anything nice, and none of the other sites fit the bill, either. Then I decided to try Etsy. I saw a few options that I was considering, but looking back, I'm *so* glad I didn't choose them. \n\nSo I kept looking, and eventually I found one particular Etsy shop that looked pretty great. I eventually came into some extra money, so earlier in 2023, I was finally able to purchase my first petticoat. I emailed the shop owner, told her what I was looking for, and asked her if she had anything like that. She got back to me pretty quickly, and recommended a glorious petticoat that was exactly what I was looking for. After getting the black dress taken care of, I bought the petticoat.  \n\nThere were some extra delays on top of an already long wait, because its a busy business that the owner is running by herself, and the order right before mine was a huge project that took longer than expected. It ended up being a several-month wait, but she answered every email and question quickly and with the utmost kindness. \n\nThen, she sent me updated product photos, and a few days later, it arrived on my doorstep.\n\nI yanked the box off my porch and raced upstairs to my bedroom to open it. And it was yard after yard after yard of gloriously soft, fluffy fabric!! I did an unboxing video and everything. I've since worn it on 3 separate occasions. I get a compliment on it every time I wear it somewhere. A few Saturdays ago, I wore it to an all-day excursion where i went to multiple places, and I got compliments what seemed like every 10 minutes. It was great.\n\nI love my petticoat, and it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. I'm wearing it to a New Year's Eve party too, and I can't wait!!\n\nI will post pictures later if anyone wants me to. :)",
