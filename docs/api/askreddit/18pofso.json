They are kind, hard workers, trustworthy, funny, and all of them are respectful. In the past, almost all of my male friends in my early/mid 20s eventually tried to sleep with me or admitted feelings for me even the ones who met me through my boyfriend or my boyfriends siblings. There was an exception to 3 guys I met through someone I dated briefly the end of my senior year of high school (it was his group of friends) and I was friends with into my early 20s...all were funny, respectful, and I felt safe and genuinely cared for when hanging out with them. As a side note: saying \"all of them\" makes it sound like I had tons of male friends...I have 3 male coworkers I consider friends and I had 6 male friends from senior year to my mid 20s.",

I know they probably spank off to it later. They'll compliment my figure then move on. But they treat me as one of the guys and let me join and compliment when I try things even if I fail. \n\nThe guys will chuckle if I say I'm astill a virgin, theyll ask why but leave it at that. They don't care what I eat. They don't care if I have a different view. \n\nHonestly, it is the women who are toxic and judgemental. It is the women making rape comments when I'm in undies. It is women telling me I suck when I fail when trying.\nIt is women judging me for being a virgin\n\nIt is women calling me a bad person for staying a virgin because I want it to be for love and not risk pregnancy (if I get raped, it is still my responsibility to try and prevent pregnancy). \n\nIt is the women judging my clothes. Women are the violent ones. I know a guy might try and rape me but at least it is expected. A woman will assault and hurt me just for smiling at a guy she likes.",
