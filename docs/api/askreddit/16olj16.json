It appeared to have everything: KB toys, a hip RadioShack, a puzzle shop, a chocolate shop, 2 bookstores, an arcade, etc. It is now only a shell of what it once was; there are still some glimmers of life, but it is passing away slowly and painfully. One of its anchor stores is on life support, while the other three-fifths are gone. The owners' constant rent increases to cover the costs of the vacant storefronts are a contributing factor in the issue.",

   "message": "The ability to purchase and keep any type of entertainment material, the real thing or a bootleg. I bring this up when it comes to offline use, mostly. \n\nNo questions asked. \n\nWhile fine for some subscriptions if the service is available, there have been times when I paid for something and got to keep it.\n\nSometimes streaming services act in ways that are merely unacceptable. In regards to my local Fox station, WFXT, Fox recently screwed up my services. When it was FOXNOW, I could watch primetime programs like *The Masked Singer* and *Smackdown*. I was furious when they just allowed sports and news when they upgraded it. Yes, I tried Tubi, no luck. \n\nAnother example is that I had the choice to download the Spice Girls album I wanted to purchase digitally from Amazon Music, allowing me to listen to it on any MP3 player while offline or burn a CD. Think again if you believe switching from Windows to Linux is to blame. Even on my phone, I attempted a workaround. I did, after all, pay for it.\n\nMany bootleggers were aware, back in the 1990s, that consumers didn't want to put up with that kind of trash. The sale of bootleg albums, books, and movies is true. Many people didn't care whether it was a bootleg when they were growing up in the hood. Indeed, I was exposed to the \"Don't Duplicate That Floppy\" ad while growing up. Ironically, a video game was the only thing you couldn't acquire a bootleg of because of their restrictions. At the time, various computer games featured peculiar copy protection, and forget about pirating console games.\n\nA catch-22 appears to exist now. \n\nFor a charge, a service is provided that offers an endless variety, but restricts what paying consumers can do with it offline.",
