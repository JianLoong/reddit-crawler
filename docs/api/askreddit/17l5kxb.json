There was always a segment at the end celebrating a HD that had driven a small, local hardware or lumber store out of business.  It would show pics of these little mom-and-pop places with \"Out of Business\" or \"Closed Permanently\" signs out front.  It was pretty sickening. If I recall, the managers of the stores celebrated each week won some sort of prize or bonus too.   \n\nBefore that, I knew that was obviously part of the overall strategy, but to see it laid out and celebrated so blatantly was shocking.  Especially since these meetings weren't exactly high up the totem pole.  I was just a \"Hardware Department Manager\" for $15/hr (2007).  I only worked there about 3 months.",

We were taught that if you called in about services being down and were trying to get them fixed, not to give you credit for the time they were down unless you asked, no matter how long it may be. Even if you did ask for credit, we often only gave it to you for days you called in. So if you had a storm roll through and didn't have service for more than one day, you had to call each day. If you took the liberty to credit them anyway, you would be coached to do it the proper way. We often used this downtime to upsell you on additional channels, faster internet speeds etc, for when it did return. We also were taught to sell higher speeds to unsuspecting customers who didn't know any better, thinking faster internet would make their 9 year old laptop/PC perform better. We got a kickback on how many ancillaries we sold. A basic rep who performed halfway decent could often make more than those that were responsible for them.",
