   "message": "There was this guy I knew who was part of a fraternity. You'll be pretty surprised to find out his name at the end. His family was extremely well off, and that's pretty much all I know. My best friend happened to be in the same fraternity and they were planning a party to celebrate a game the football team had won. I was helping set up and in turn got to stay for the party. About two hours in, he pumped into me from behind and made me spill my drink all over my shirt. He helped me clean it up and we made small talk. How things were with classes and whatnot. But then we didn't stop talking, and one topic just rolled right onto the next. Eventually I asked him about his family and what they did to be so rich like everyone had talked about. He confided in me and said that his dad owned a law firm, but they had to file for bankruptcy due to some under the table stuff he wouldn't talk about. So they were about to lose pretty much everything. He didn't know if he'd be able to continue with college. I felt for him and asked him what he planned on doing. He said we was most likely going to drop out and work. Do delivery services when he's not at work. Try to save up as much money as he could to help his family. And a month later, he did just that. I decided to follow him on Instagram and we talked every so often after that. Eventually he was able to save enough money to start a career in music. He would book smaller gigs at bars. One day, someone heard a couple of his songs and wanted to give him a bigger opportunity. And that's how he got to where he is today. He is the one, the only. Joe Mama.",
