   "message": "Down vote me if you want but politicians\n\nIf i were the richest man alive then I'd have well over $100b. I honestly can't imagine what I could possibly do with that kind of money that I couldn't just as easily do with $50m. So I'd keep that for myself and spend the other $99.95b and spend it on campaign donations. I could literally start my own political party with that kind of money. Republicans and Democrats, combined, spent less than $15b on elections in 2020 and less than $10b in 2022. I would personally fund the campaigns of the most progressive and qualified candidates I could find. I didn't work for this money and I don't give a shit about making it grow, I have zero incentive to elect politicians who will keep me rich. Instead, I want politicians who will fix the tax code, push for universal health care, tuition free university, criminal justice reform, green energy, and other programs a first world nation should have. The argument that we can't do any of this because \"we don't have the money\" is bullshit as many of these changes either save us money or generate money. The only reason we aren't fixing these problems is because there are too many rich assholes in the world profiting off the system staying broken. They spend their profits on political donations and lobbying to keep the system broke. If you want to stop them, then outspend them. Fight fire with fire.\n\n(I would also probably build my own Disneyland, but that only costs like $5b to build, depending on where. Still plenty left over to do the political thing)",
