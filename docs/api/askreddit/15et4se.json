Fast flight, and real estate in Russia and abroad, to rent houses on the coast, and nothing to receive income. The rest is charity, powerful people with limited interests. Bionic prostheses, etc. Yes, and also the study of the Bermuda Triangle, personally, of course. Exploring the North and South Poles.",
