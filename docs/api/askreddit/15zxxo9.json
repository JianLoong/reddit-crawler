From around 8 years old to about 16, my mom would go down to do laundry and my Stepdad would go down to talk to her. I thought for the longest time it was just their little adult gathering place. They would even had their friends go down there as well. When they went down, a few minutes later, I would smell this odd smell.\n\nAs I got older, and got in high school, I had a more \"rebel\" sister. I finally found out what the smell was through her.\n\nIt was marijuana...lol. Oddly enough, going through D.A.R.E and all that, I always thought it would basically rot your brain and turn you into  some type of zombie. That was a lie.",

I found the receipt from her order and had the receipt from the withdrawal and demanded to at least get my money back if she was going to reneg on our deal. She denied ever making such a deal, ever taking money from my account, and said I should be thankful I got anything at all.\n\nFor reference my family was by no means poor. My mom had a second antique car she drove in the summer. Dad had a boat, motorcycle, and ATV all high end bought new. And they took 2 vacations a year without us kids minimum. While I struggled to have lunch money on a consistent basis. This was the moment that solidified my  belief that my parents didn't give a single fuck and I needed to *never* rely on them again.",

   "message": "That because of my 3.2 high school GPA I may have to \"go back\" to the German equivalent of high school ‚Äî even though I had graduated and was in my first semester of college ‚Äî¬†if I moved there when my family did.\n\nMy Dad's company was transferring him to Germany in 1990. I had graduated high school in 1989 and was in my first year of community college (at the time).\n\nTruth is they just didn't want me to come along because I was 19 and to them I should be on my own already. So they made it sound like I would have a very hard time getting into college in Germany because of their very high educational standards.\n\nI knew my situation was weird because I was an adult and Germany's education (especially higher) system works differently, but I know plenty of young adult peers who followed their parents over when they got transferred (I came from a town where the company employed just about everybody, so a lot of families continued to be friends overseas). I bumped into two people I went to school with when I would visit them, and their GPAs in high school had been lower than mine.\n\nThe result is that my kid brother got the best education someone might get, while I ended up trying to make ends meet and lived in a drug den for 6 months after my attempt at the military failed. That's not jealousy or envy, I say these things to show what the results of believing or making up BS stories instead of just being honest can do. I actually don't regret the path I've taken, but I do wonder how my life would be different if I had been able to live over there with them for a while, and it does make me angry to think my parents would make up something like that just out of some notion that a 19 year old adult son barely out of high school would be \"dead weight\" for them.",

   "message": "My family had a specific bad habit that caused me lots of issues as I grew and after I became an adult.\n\nMy family is fairly tight knit, there are tonnes of us also. To give an idea, every generation prior to my grandparents had kids numbering in the double digits, and most of them went on to have kids themselves. Of my grandparents one grandmother was 1 of 7, the other three grandparents were one of 3 or 2. So as you can imagine there are SO MANY COUSINS! \n\nAnd many continue to live in the same part of the country, hell many the same town.\n\nNow whenever ANYTHING happened, everyone would be on the phone updating the various relatives. It meant I as an only child pretty much had my entire life narrated around the family tree from birth. School picture day? Mum and dad would buy the biggest photo packet the school did, probably like 30+ copies of the same picture in different sizes, cause all the cousins had to see how big I had got! \n\nThis has an unintended result of to me, random adults approaching me in the street and grabbing me/hugging me or just otherwise touching me. I ended up developing a dislike of being touched at all, but especially by people outside of my immediate 7-9 members of my family, namely parents, grandparents and my uncle/his kids. I‚Äôd freak out, run away, fight, cry anything when these situations kept happening. Eventually my mum was able to spread around the family my dislike, and most of those ‚Äòrandom‚Äô adults at least began speaking to me, introducing themselves and explaining who they are before trying to initiate contact, but some of them never did and even seemed to make it a game to be able to grab at me before I could spot them and run. It wasn‚Äôt fun, like at all. It didn‚Äôt fully stop until my mid teens, when I quite literally would scream at the top of my lungs in public, usually alone the lines of ‚ÄòWho the hell are you!?!‚Äô And actually began kicking people to hurt them. I gained a rep as the ‚Äòunfriendly‚Äô kid in some family circles, but luckily the majority had respected my dislike once they knew about it, and knew I was a friendly kid if you just talked to me first. \n\nA related issue with this chain network of updates on everything a family member did, was how my parents and grandparents worked together to catch me in little lies or misbehaviours as a young kid. Let‚Äôs say I was naughty at home, I‚Äôd go to visit my grandparents a few days later, and it would be ‚ÄòA little birdie told me you were very naughty, I don‚Äôt think naughty girls should get treats from Nan/grandpa.‚Äô Like this would happen after I‚Äôd already had whatever punishment my parents gave, and all would be forgiven at home. I genuinely wasn‚Äôt a naughty kid overall, I disliked my parents being mad/disappointed in me so I followed rules and behaved well excluding typical tantrum stuff from those ages. But that feeling of any mistake I made never being forgotten/forgiven? That any singular punishment wouldn‚Äôt be the end of it even when the adults dealing with the issue we‚Äôre happy again? \n\nThat has stuck with me over the years. I still really struggle with failure, I‚Äôm often terrified of getting anything wrong, because everyone will know and will never forget. Even small mistakes, I convince myself that as more people find out, the judgement and reproach won‚Äôt end, that it‚Äôll keep getting bigger and eventually no one will want anything to do with me. I‚Äôve developed a number of problems with accepting mistakes, and not trying to hide them or pretend they never happened without dealing with the consequences or fallout. I‚Äôve even nearly ended up in debt because I was too terrified to tell my family during a period I was struggling to support myself. My family is full of lovely people, and my immediate relatives would give me the world, I know this, but the fear of the never ending disappointment paralyses me. \n\nIm getting better, but it‚Äôs a hard road to unlearn things I‚Äôve believed for more than 2 decades.",
