 "selftext": "My wife and I went to a Bill Burr show last week, they had a strict no phone policy. I had my phone in the bag they provided she told security she didn’t have her phone on her. \nDuring the show she started using her phone I told her to please put it away but she didn’t \nAfter a few minutes security came over to kick her out. She said to me let’s go and I said I’d meet up with her after the show. I could tell she was mad at me but I’ve been looking forward to the show for months. \nI stayed for the entire show and once I left I texted her so I could drive us home but she took an Uber and when I got home for bedroom door was closed so I slept on the couch. The show was in a casino there was plenty of things for her to do while I was still at the show. \nAITAH?",
