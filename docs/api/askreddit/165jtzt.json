It's fun when you're in a little village in Italy(replace Italy with about any country) and the lights go out. \"Oh look at the stars!\". When the electricity going off 4 times a month for hours at a time and you have to go to work, it's not quite as majestic. The biggest advantage I like about the U.S. is its diversity of everything. If you don't like the way things are where you live, there is a good chance that moving a few miles away may make things totally different. Still don't like it, move to the next state instead. Hate the heat, move to Minnesota. Hate the cold, move to the south. Want a big house you can afford, we have LOTS of space with places where land is cheap.

The landscapes across the country are varied. It is relatively easier to find a job here (the severity of people not being able to find work or being passed up for nepotism is extremely exaggerated, especially on Reddit). Everyone is very open and nice to each other (another one that gets exaggerated to an extreme degree, the emotional ones are a loud minority and nobody likes them).\n\nOf course, the people pointing out the bad aren‚Äôt entirely wrong, there is a gun problem, and there are cases of people struggling to afford healthcare; but, and I‚Äôm probably going to get flack for this, again those issues have been exaggerated to an unfairly extreme degree. The country isn‚Äôt the Wild West where everyone is shooting each other (or in other words, you‚Äôre completely safe pretty much everywhere besides very specific areas of the country); and despite what the internet wants to paint the picture as, the strong majority across a wide range of income levels have zero problems affording their healthcare. Most of the ‚ÄúI rode 50 feet in an ambulance and they‚Äôre making me pay $50k‚Äù horror stories are flat bullshit where the person just posted their unadjusted (keyword) medical bill and called that the final total.\n\nThere‚Äôs still stuff to criticize the US for, but after traveling around in my 20‚Äôs, I‚Äôve learned that the grass isn‚Äôt that much greener on the other side. Other countries have their issues too, and what I‚Äôve learned is that they‚Äôre all pretty comparable.\n\nEdit: In case you plan on leaving a reply, I‚Äôm kinda just stating my piece and moving on. I‚Äôve argued with redditors enough over the past decade, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt really care what you guys have to say anymore. Live in your bubble and I‚Äôll live in mine I guess.",
