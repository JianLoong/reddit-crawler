Or to put it simply, the reason we are all living is because we are alive.\r  \n\r  \nThe purpose of our being - this topic seems so intriguing that you'll find yourself pondering over it for a very long time, only to find that the answer is very simple! In order to find the answer, I started with discussions, read a few books, searched on the internet. After all that, I believe that life is best lived if we stop searching for it's reason!\r  \n\r  \nLet's assume that there IS a purpose. When, I try to find that purpose, I'm continuously in the look out for something and that keeps me anxious.\r  \nMy question here is: How can one even recognise his/her purpose of life? What if I've already achieved my purpose?!! And also, people say that you learn till the end of your life. That means you cannot master or understand life till death. If that is right, how can one EVER know the purpose??\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, if I assume that there is no purpose, I simply live. Because I HAVE to live. And since I'm living now, I have to do something to while away my time. I start to do things that I'm interested in. And when I do something that I like, I'm happy. When I improve, I'm happier. I'm not anxious about the future, as I'm not expecting anything. Hence, the peace of mind.\r  \n\r  \nSo, make sure that your time here on Earth, is well utilised. Do good. If u can't, try atleast to Do No Harm. Happy living! :)",

Think of the possibilities life can offer, even if that possibility is \"one day I won't feel like this\". \n\nMy reasons are: being able to connect with others, sunshine on a cool day, coffee, knowing I can learn new things. I had to start living in the moment instead of wasting away in the past or trying to predict my future. \n\nMaybe you won't always feel like you have a \"proper\" reason. When I've made attempts I've definitely felt like that, and I've also spent years existing instead of living. Possibility keeps me going :-) (Also a mega FUCK TON of therapy)",
