He’s highly regarded not just by audiences, but by comics as well; being a major influence for many comics today.  He never stopped writing and didn’t repeat bits.  He had a new special every couple years for decades.  Much of his material is timeless… Still relevant despite being decades old.  He could make you laugh and make you think.  He was capable of making the most serious topics funny while also making legit criticisms. \n\nWhen something crazy happens in the world and people say “I wish I could hear what _____ would say about this”, the vast majority of the time that blank is filled in with Carlin.",
