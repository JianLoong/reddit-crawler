I let my now-retired former coworker know about them and it’s her main social circle now and she does all their events. \n\nAlso see what free events your city might have going on. One time my city put on an educational event on owls and who knew — a great time was had. (In before someone asks if it was a hoot. But yes it was.)\n\nThere are meetup sites that’ll give you ideas. Outdoor stuff. Theater groups. Comedy groups. Birdwatching (which I’m told is much more fun than one would think). Dance groups. Tricia teams. Star Wars fan chapters. Etc.\n\nSo try things and see what sticks. I like doing things alone but don’t mind exploring interests with others. See what suits you in that regard. You might find that you haven’t been able to find that you like because you’ve only ever tried with others or alone.\n\nAnother idea is to take time to think about someone you really admire/think is cool/think is enjoying life. Do some of those same activities if you’re able, or adapt them to make them accessible. \n\nI don’t have any huge plans for myself in the immediate, but have decided to just enjoy life in part by exploring what I find fun and interesting.\n\nYou can have fun even though you’re not good at something.",

That concept is a huge myth and is just something other people on the outside think when they see someone successful. They may have liked something, but it was hard work, the discipline to make a choice and stick with it, and years of study that actually made that person useful and employable.\n\nNow for those who don't think they like anything enough to choose, or don't feel \"called\" to any specific field or job, they usually wind up in a torporous state of self recrimination. What they need to realize is that a job is not a marriage. \n\nThere is no \"one\" thing they were meant to do. This mistaken belief can lead people to believe that if they pick badly they will be forever miserable. What they actually are doing is making themselves miserable. They just need to pick something.\n\nIn fact, it can be a blessing to NOT feel strongly pulled to a specific job. A person can unencumber themselves from the baggage of hoping to do the absolute perfect job they love, only to spend years studying it, racking up tons of debt, and then finding themselves under- or unemployed because they followed a \"passion\" instead of making a pragmatic decision to pick something that is highly employable and lucrative.\n\n\"Passions\" are for personal time, not a career, for two reasons. First, I've made the case this often leads people astray. Secondly, the surest way to turn something they love into something they hate is to have to do it for someone else, their way, for too little money, for too many hours per week. \n\nResearch jobs, training pipelines, employment data, earning potential.

   "message": "Enjoy yourself. Enjoy who you are. \n\nWe all feel this at some point but the truth is that I fear you may actually be sane. You’re falling victim to the depression of self realization. This world is built for those who submit to it. You aren’t satisfied with embracing a life of compromise. \n\nDon’t compare yourself to others or punish yourself for what you haven’t done. Stop trying to control how others see you and find out who you are. If you’re on reddit then I’m sure you have found some interests. \n\nYour natural abilities don’t lie in the areas that you seem to have a “natural” skill. They don’t depend on the recognition of others. Natural ability is a shadow cast by the natural curiosity. Every prodigy is the result of obsession and single minded drive. \n\nI’ve felt how you’ve felt and even asked this exact question. Then I realized that all your anxiety and fear is an illusion. You can set it down at any moment. Meditate. Just breathe. When your mind wanders don’t get upset. When you realize your mind has wandered, smile, forgive yourself and breathe. Just focus on the feeling of the breath entering and exiting your lungs. \n\nForget ability and inclination. Embrace curiosity. Slake that curiosity endlessly. \n\nI bet you’re a dope person. You’re probably intelligent too. Having a mindless job isn’t a bad thing. It frees up your mental resources for your passions. Just try to explore. Try art, music, astronomy, writing, whatever your mind craves.",

But that changes as you get older, if you don't live your life and experience anything then you just waste it away.\n\nBeen working with a lot of older people and there's a big difference between the people who lived their lives and the people who just worked and meandered through it.
