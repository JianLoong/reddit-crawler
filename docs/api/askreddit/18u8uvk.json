I had to go to the hospital in the capital and get my stomach pumped and experience the joys of a hospital in a third world country where you play Russian roulette with your life. Luckily we had money to pay them.\n\nI never touched or drank alcohol again. I've been sober 13 years.",

After meds were done and all had lost 20 lbs in 2 weeks and just very week with the runs from antibiotics. Ended up on toilet and felt really weird. Called my bf with help. By the time bf got to me my lips were turning blue and he couldn‚Äôt get me to wake up. Next thing I know I am waking up yo paramedics talking to me. So surreal. Ride to the hospital, tests run, fluids given and everything was okay. Just from loss of fluids and all that it was a short visit and weird as all hell.",

I'm on a big rider mower and was looking at the grass, making sure I'm going straight since I'm on a sideways incline, but then I look up and I'm about to collide from the chin upwards with an aluminum roadsign, and just barely dodge my head around it. The mower would not have stopped, and the sign would not have bent",
