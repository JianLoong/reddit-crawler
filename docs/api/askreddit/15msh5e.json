The term \"internetworking\" was coined in the early 1970's and was applied to any interconnection between switched local networks. When Cerf and Kahn proposed the IP protocol for network communications, they borrowed the term and described their proposal as an internetworking protocol. Somewhere between the first proposal and V4, their \"Internetworking Protocol\" was shortened to \"Internet Protocol\". \n\nHumorously, this means that the word \"internet\" actually predates the Internet. DARPANet wasn't converted to use the Internet Protocol until 1983, and that's regularly cited as the starting point for the modern Internet that we use today.",
