It‘s just, all these years you basically didn‘t even french kiss me and now …pfffffthahahahahahaha“\n\nOkay, i‘ll admit, i did not know that actually rolling on the floor while laughing was a thing, especially with beautiful, etheral, very much *undead* vampires was a thing but here we are.

All these years of caution for naught. \n\n„Okay, okay, I think I got it all out.

Aside from the occasional twitch of her lips and her still trembling shoulders she really pulled it off. „I didn‘t even know babies teeth that early…“ I grumbled. \n\nWhich set my wife off again. „Look at the bright side.
