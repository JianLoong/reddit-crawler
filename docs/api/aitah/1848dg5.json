 "selftext": "I’ve (32) been with my girlfriend (35) for about 6 years, yesterday she open up one of my bank statements and found out about my “nest egg” which I’ve been building for about 10 years in the goal of retiring early. When she found out about my secret Savings she was pissed and confronted me which led to a heated argument as she is of the belief that what’s mine is hers and vice versa, she said that instead of storing the money away pointlessly I should’ve been helping pay off her daughters (from a previous relationship) student debt and demanded that I transfer the money to our joint account. I don’t think I’m in the wrong for doing what I want with my own money and even though I love the kid I believe she should handle her own debts just like I did when I went to college.\n\nAm I the asshole here?",
