He was even caught having inappropriate interactions with a team lead who is well over his age. Our leadership does nothing to discipline him whatsoever.

He is now sleeping with a former coworker who works for a different hospital now. We think his sense of being able to get away with all this comes from his parents giving him a lot of money and enabling him to not move forward with his life since we don‚Äôt make that great of a wage.
