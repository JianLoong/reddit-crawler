And it was ALSO a super rare show from the era to have running arc storylines across seasons. It even used non-standard camerawork, like handheld cameras.\n\nBasically, HSB laid the groundwork for every serious/gritty cop show to follow for the next several decades, like The Wire and soforth. But no one ever talks about HSB any more, even though it ran for something like seven years and was incredibly popular.",

The show won 29 Emmys, a record that would not be broken until 2002. The episode \"Chuckles Bites the Dust\" was ranked as the #1 television episode of all time by TV Guide. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked The Mary Tyler Moore Show No. 6 on its list of the \"101 Best Written TV Series of All Time\". In 2007 Time put The Mary Tyler Moore Show on its list of \"17 Shows That Changed TV\". Tina Fey modeled 30 Rock on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, and its series finale heavily influenced the final episode of Friends.\n\nMTM Enterprises was started by Moore and her husband Grant Tinker to produce the show, and it would go on to produce shows like Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, both Bob Newhart shows, and WKRP in Cincinnati, among others.",

But while those shows are both still culturally relevant and streaming hits, nobody cares about this show at all now. Tim Allen is more remembered for Santa Clause and Toy Story.\n\nDynasty - People remember Dallas, but Dynasty actually surpassed it popularity for a bit, and it was the #1 show in TV at one point.\n\nWithout a Trace - After CSI popularized the crime scene investigation procedural, there was a massive influx. Some also became binge shows people remember like NCIS, but Without a Trace was a top 10 hit for multiple seasons and nobody seems to remember it even in comparison to shows it was a bigger hit than like Bones.\n\nThen thereâ€™s just all the other random 90â€™s sitcoms that were actually massive top 10 hits but didnâ€™t have the impact of Friends, Seinfeld, Will \u0026amp; Grace, and so on.
