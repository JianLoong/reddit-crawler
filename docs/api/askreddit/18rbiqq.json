   "message": "my MIL gave us homemade applesauce and strawberry jam. she lives in Seattle, we‚Äôre in Boston. the applesauce was in a  tupperware and the jam was in jars with wax seals topped with aluminum foil. there was a packet of ‚Äúblue ice‚Äù included, but everything was room temperature by the time we got it. based on the postage label, it was in transit for a week. my husband insists it‚Äôs fine to eat.\n\nedits: MIL is 90. She‚Äôs preparing to move into a senior living facility in a few months - she‚Äôs spry enough for her age, but honestly thought this was a lovely gift. She won‚Äôt be doing any cooking once she moves, so this is a one-time thing. \n\nThere is no chance the jam was canned in a hot water bath, she told me years ago that she only makes freezer jam. \n\nI‚Äôve put everything in the freezer while my husband insists this is safe to eat. I‚Äôm not willing to risk it, but he‚Äôs an adult who can make his own gastrointestinal choices.",
