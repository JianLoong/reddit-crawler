 "selftext": "On a night walk to coburg north coles just now, saw a Lab or golden retriever walking around, beigeish coat, really dirty, had a harness on, tried to approach him but he ran down A'beckett St off Gaffney. Hoping he gets found! my fear is that he was ditched, tho not sure why he'd have a harness on, maybe ran away. Either way he was last seen on Gaffney st just down from coles. ",
