   "message": "Very specific story incoming….\n\nI once was a bright eyed young Christian who “felt called” into ministry. I enrolled in my small Christian denomination’s ministry college. It was everything I dreamed of, 4 amazing and fun years filled with memories. I obtained a job at that college and planned on becoming a professor. This place was like my Hogwarts, I loved every second of it. My best friend/ college roommate started a church on campus and then got a position at the school alongside me and quickly worked his way up to being my boss. I though I was living the dream. Then the pandemic happened and I was called into my best friend/dorm roommate/pastor/boss’s office and fired 3 months after he got the position. I was told that I just didn’t fit gods plan for the university anymore. Now at this point it’s important enough I give some additional context - I worked in a very public role that had me on stages across the country promoting this school. Basically a PR role. I am overweight and single. About a week after he became my boss, he told me one night at his house that I needed to lose weight or he would reduce and change my role and that I needed to find someone to marry quickly and basically had someone handpicked out for me to marry. I let the weight thing slide because we are friends and apart of me understands that a massively overweight guy isn’t the best guy to be the face of PR and Student Recruitment, but I am not going to marry someone in not interested in nor did I want to be in a relationship as I had just gotten out of a very toxic one that I hadn’t completely put behind me. So back to the main story, pandemic happens and he seizes the opportunity to “let me go” because they can’t afford to keep everyone due to projected losses. The 12 other people that were “let go” believes the excuse but I knew better. Number one, we had a record number of students enrolled for the upcoming semester and I had recruited around 50% of them myself so I had more than earned my salary. Number two, I knew that every name on the list that was “let go” were people he was looking to get rid of for reason ranging from “they’re weird/quirky, fat and lazy, old and outdated/ not sheep that easily bend”.\n\nI walked out of his office and never spoke to him again. I am now no longer a “believer” and my life is a living hell because he took everything from me and cast me out back to my crazy bipolar psychotic mother and my life is ruined now.\n\nIf I won the lottery, I would enact my revenge. I would find a way to purchase that school and then I would show up in my best suit and personally fire him and all of his cronies. And then I would close the school down and donate the land to the Satanic Temple. I would spend a large amount of what’s left roadblocking and making his life a living hell like mine has been for three years. I would fabricate photos of him cheating on his wife and ruin his marriage, I would drive him to the point where he has lost everything just like he did to me. And then I would take what’s left and go live a decent life and pay for my Nana to have the best nurses and healthcare she could have and make her final days more comfortable and I’d sleep soundly at night knowing I beat him and his god.\n\nThis is my super villain origin story.",
