I didnâ€™t want to stand in the way of his happiness. \n\nEach time he pulled me back to him and insisted that I stay. \n\nSo I did. \n\nWe ended up getting physical, but even now, he wonâ€™t call me his. He wonâ€™t tell me what he thinks of me or what sort of relationship he wants. \n\nSooooo\n\nThis year I decided to move forward with my life. I didnâ€™t think itâ€™s healthy for either of us for things to continue the way things have been. \n\nI unfollowed him on Instagram and had his account unfollow me too ( you can do that on the app these days ) and I deleted the app off my phone soon after. \n\n We still text now again and work together.
