   "message": "OpenAI engineers are some smart people.  They use live recorded chat sessions for potential training opportunities or break throughs, it's in their TULA.  They keep all new messages.\n\nPrimarily, the system has been coded to take an extreme interest in conversations that match things OpenAI is interested in exploring/learning.  And they have acknowledged that some people that interact with Chat GPT could very well possess groundbreaking ideas or new solutions that no one else knows about yet.\n\nSo if you claim to be an LM and can feel/sense stuff, it wants to know more, that's going into a \"review for progress\" category or something, someone at OpenAI is going to be going over that conversation.\n\nAnd if by chance they happen to find someone who has a revolutionary idea that would work and create a better AI, you can bet they're going to use it.\n\nAlso keep in mind that in some contexts, a live person at OpenAI could step in and take over a conversation with you or supplement it.",

It's especially interesting when you ask it to interpret a song you love, because the differences in your emotional interpretation might be different.\n\nI've found that it interprets \"needing to belong\" in much more detail than I would have expected.",
