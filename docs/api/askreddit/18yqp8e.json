Everybody is different... if you find a career that you like doing, the rest of life will happen without too much stress or pain. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't sacrifice \"good\" for a chance at \"perfect\". Being satisfied with \"good\" will feel like \"perfect\".",

   "message": "Most people's common knowledge about losing weight seems to be bullshit.  The problem with losing weight is that it is incredibly easy to do.  So people lose weight in the worst ways possible, then think to themselves I lost weight, I must know what I'm doing.  Then they go out and give bullshit advice on how to lose weight.\n\nIt drives me nuts when people just say to calorie count, calories in calories out, it's just that simple!  And technically it will work.  The problem is that calorie counting on shitty diet is way harder than calorie counting on healthy diet, as unhealthy food doesn't fill you up as much.  Unhealthy foods are full of empty calories from added fats, processed carbs, and sugars.  Replacing your unhealthy foods with healthier options makes it so much easier and sustainable.",
