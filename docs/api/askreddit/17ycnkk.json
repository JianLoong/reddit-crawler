   "message": "Starting with the Op itself, the first thing they do is inject the anesthetic. To me, the initial jab was fine, but the stuff pushing in did feel like someone was squeezing my balls for a good few seconds before it kicked in. The cutting was completely painless after that. Yeah, you feel a bit of a tug and can hear the snips being made, but the doctor was nice and chatty so you don't focus on it. The smell as they cauterise is interesting to say the least, then they put on some burny stuff right at the end to seal you up. That feels like a tingle that gets steadily hotter and hotter. Didn't hurt as much as the starting ball squeeze though (forgot they do this again when moving onto the next ball).\n\nPost op I was uncomfortable and the balls did feel bruised. Had to dodge my children who often run around at ball height. I would say I felt comfortable enough to have a tug at around 2 weeks. After 3-4 weeks, all back to normal. No change to how it looked before except for occasional bit of blood mixed in.\n\nNext step is to tug and have sex as much as possible. You have 4 months to wait for your first test, and you want to aim for about 80 releases or so to clear your tubes as it were. That is a long 4 months by the way, and waiting on my first test. Still then have to do another test a month later to get the all clear.\n\nOverall, defo the right choice for me and the wife. Just waiting for the benefits now üòÅ",

It started as a sort of dull ache, then when the throbbing started I decided to say something and the doc gave me another shot. ...which only lasted a couple minutes and before long I was four shots deep and my lower body was starting to shake and sweat profusely. I wouldn't say it was *painful* per SE but it was intensely uncomfortable. Thankfully he finished up before things got worse; when I stood up the sheet under me was absolutely **soaked** so that was embarrassing.  \n  \nAfterwards it took about a month for the stitches to dissolve and the pain (which again I would just describe as \"intensely uncomfortable\") to go away. A bit longer than they said it would take but no complications to speak of. Plus it barely cost anything with my insurance, I think I only paid like $90. I'd highly recommend.  \n  \nFun aside: my so and I definitely took note that not one person asked me if I was sure I wanted the procedure.

I go to the lab, and they see what I'm there for. They handed me a cup and told me that all the bathrooms were full, and I would have to find a bathroom elsewhere. I asked if I could take it home, and they said no. \"We have to see the specimen within so many minutes.\" So I find some privacy away from the main areas of the hospital and do my business.
