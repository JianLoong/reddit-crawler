Still more angry at the bastards who put me in here than scared.\"\n\n\"Eh, you don't got much to worry about.  I got your back.  What are you even in for?\"\n\n\"Murder.\"\n\n\"Oh...you do it?\"\n\n\"I tried.\"\n\n\"Well, bet he deserved it.\"\n\n\"Sure did.\"\n\n\"Heh, give yourself some time and you'll be head of the block.  Home invasion feels pretty lame by comparison.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"So what would you be doing if you weren't here right now?\" she asked Bea.\n\n\"Hmm...I'd probably be off in another world.  Find a mushroom circle and leave it all behind.\"\n\n\"Heh heh, I'm more of a molly gal but I've had a time or two on shrooms when I was younger.\"\n\n\"Yeah...They take me to a much nicer place.  Full of colors and people who only act in good faith with each other.\"\n\n\"Sure sounds like a fairytale land.\"\n\n\"It is.  One time Ophelia took me to ride a pegasus.\"\n\n\"The magic horn horses?\"\n\n\"That's a unicorn.  And they're scary.\"\n\n\"Yanno what I always thought so.  Having a horn like that is pretty much straight up a 'fuck around and find out' sort of thing.\"\n\n\"That and they eat your heart.\"\n\n\"Yikes.  Pegasus don't do that?\"\n\n\"Nope.  They're pretty mild-mannered.  These were raised by a friend of hers.  I never rode one before but she did so I held on as she flew us around the forest for a while.  It was awesome.\"\n\n\"Wow, you gotta get me some of those shrooms when we're out.\"\n\n\"Heh, once we're out I'll totally take you.  The fae realm is a magical place.\"\n\n\"Fae realm?\"\n\n\"The other side of the mushroom circle.\"\n\n\"Oh shit, that's a cool name for it.  *Fae realm*.  What else you do there?\"\n\n\"I like to explore.  The trees glow and there's all these really colorful flowers.  Sometimes I'll just walk around all day under blue and purple trees and sleep in golden bushes.  Spring is the best because that's when everything's really coming to life.  Everything's-\"\n\n\"Hey, sleep time, shut it!\"\n\n\"Fuckin' guards.  Tell me more tomorrow Bea.\"\n\n\"Sure thing Rachel.\"\n\n\\----------------  \nAll crit/feedback welcome!  \nr/TomesOfTheLitchKing  \nFollow my Summer Challenge progress [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TomesOfTheLitchKing/comments/14c22dj/ot_summer_challenge/)",
