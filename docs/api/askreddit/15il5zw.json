I've tried several recipes everything from slowly simmering full fat milk while adding sugar, to cooking condensed milk in the slow cooker, and nothing compares to the cheap stuff you can buy in the store. There's just something about their bulk process that just produces a better caramelized milk and sugar product than anything I can make from home. Better taste, consistency, texture and mouthfeel, just better. I've seen the same thing in Argentina, Colombia and Nicaragua too. The homemade stuff is amazing, but the manufactured stuff is perfection for some reason.",
