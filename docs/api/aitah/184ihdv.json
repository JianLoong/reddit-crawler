 "selftext": "My wife is 19 weeks pregnant with our first child.\n\nIn the beginning she had bad morning sickness. One time it was really bad, she was working from home that day and I was at work. My sister wasn't working that day so my wife texted and asked her to bring some ginger ale since we didn't have any. My sister did. She has also texted other family members for minor things: asking my dad to come over and do the laundry because she wasn't feeling sick or asking my aunt to come and clean up the mess from when she dropped a glass jar of tomato sauce. My wife's only family are her parents and they live in another province now. She only asks my family for help if I'm not available because I'm at work or not home. She's not asking for the moon or anything either.\n\nI would have thought my family would be happy to help her but they are not. Even though they have done what she asked at first. My dad said it is excessive. My brother said he isn't an errand boy. My aunt said she isn't a servant. Others also complain. Even my sister (who I thought out of everyone would understand because she a labour and delivery nurse) says my wife is asking too much.\n\nI told my family how hurt I am that they aren't supporting my wife. Some of them are parents though none of them have been pregnant before, but I haven't been pregnant I and I'm doing whatever she asks. They said they don't mind helping once in a while but now they are complaining.",
