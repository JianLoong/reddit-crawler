I had a whole post ready to go kicking off the World Tour next month and then when I went to post it I noticed we’re still in July. I’ve spent the last day grabbing constraints from people to make yet another fun assortment of disparate constraints to shove together into a beautiful mad story. This week we have some underused words, a challenging sentence, and a thought provoking moratorium on dialogue. It’ll definitely take some pondering and piecing, but I have faith in you all!\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nPrevious Mad Libs:\n\n\n[Mad Libs I](https://redd.it/fr74i3)  \n[Mad Libs II](https://redd.it/gu1kio)  \n[Mad Libs III](https://redd.it/ijektc)  \n[Mad Libs IV](https://redd.it/k3cswe)  \n[Mad Libs V](https://redd.it/l9gb8l)  \n[Mad Libs VI](https://redd.it/noe45k)  \n[Mad Libs VII](https://redd.it/pdyb6m)  \n[Mad Libs VIII](https://redd.it/qjs8wa)  \n[Mad Libs IX](https://redd.it/sgddhu)    \n[Mad Libs X](https://redd.it/v0hqaj)  \n[Mad Libs XI](https://redd.it/wcyd8w)  \n[Mad Libs XII](https://redd.it/yhusu8)  \n[Mad Libs XIII](https://redd.it/10oceiz)  \n[Mad Libs XIV](https://redd.it/134l1dr)  \n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\n###How to Contribute:\n\n\u0026amp;nbsp;\n\nWrite a story or poem, **no more than 800 words** in the comments using **at least two** things from the three categories below.
