 "selftext": "In most ARPGs you know immediately when a quality item drops. You get that big dopamine rush. You feel that FK YES moment. It's a high worth chasing in your free moments.\n\nIn D4 you don't really know when a good item drops. You pick up a giant bag of loot and think \"I hope one of these is good\". You go back to town, sort through your giant bag, and scratch your head. You do this many times. Eventually your calculus identifies something marginally better and you're like \"should I equip this?\". \n\nThis process destroys my dopamine boner. That's it. That's my problem. I want instant dopamine hits.\n\nAnyone else feel like this?",
