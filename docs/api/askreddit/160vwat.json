Its great, and the charity aspect of church is actually quite astonishing. They should get way more credit for what they provide. \n\nBut the stand up, kneel down, pray to your Lord and master and live this way or fuxking else!!! \n\nThat bit annoys me. I can't listen to someone telling me to subject myself to a master. \n\nReligion is a beautiful thing. The solace in believing we will see loved ones again is comforting in the hardest of times. \n\nBut preachy McPreach down there can go fuck himself.",

During the gay marriage debate it was pretty well argued to me that the apologetics about being gay being consistent with my religion didn't really work. In my religion, God doesn't like the gays. The concept that God made people gay and then bans them from living their lives is just so against my personal values that I found myself in a moral argument with God in which I didn't think God had a acceptable position. It was a real crisis.\nThere are other things too, of course, but that was a big one.",

What they're and how you end up in either one. He hyped up heaven and emphasized how bad hell is. When he got to the point that my default option is to go to the worst place imaginable, I became disillusioned. I wondered if an omnipotent god is so cruel to send people to enternal damnation if they don't believe in this one faith. What about the people who were too young to accept the sky daddy as their savior? What about the people who otherwise lived a good life, but believed in something different.\n\nA couple years later I tried another church that was awesome, but I never felt the holy spirit or whatever gets people to go to church every Sunday.",

I did not go to seminary but might as well have: I taught adult Bible study and gave sermons and did baptisms when my congregation needed someone to fill in. \n\nNaturally, since my wife and I grew up in pastor's families, we took our obligation to financially support the church seriously. I volunteered on the board and counted the money. Most of its budget came from me and my wife. We supported our church with our time, our money, our administrative expertise, and our knowledge of Lutheran history and traditions.\n\nThen the church got a new pastor. He was an arrogant prick. He wasn't very smart or well-educated. He lacked administrative or practical skills. He often got Lutheran dogma laughably wrong, and insisted on displaying the Baptist \"Christian\" flag next to the altar. But he thought lay leaders of the church should defer to him in everything. He even told a master electrician in the congregation how to make electrical repairs.\n\nMy mom (herself a retired pastor) calls his type \"Herr Pastor\". In the early days of the Lutheran Church in America, most of its leaders came from Germany and had very high opinions of themselves. They considered themselves the upper class. Perhaps equivalent to insisting on being addressed as \"sir\", they wanted to be called \"Herr\". This did not go over well in egalitarian America. \n\nBut this new guy was so ignorant that when I started calling him \"Herr Pastor\" to his face he thought I was being respectful. \n\nThen \"Herr Pastor\" told us that we could not sit in the front pew anymore, because our small children were \"disruptive\". \n\nThat was the last straw for me. If it was no longer welcoming for little children, I could no longer pretend that the Church I grew up in still existed. \n\nI gathered my family and left. And took our money and support with us, along with the next generation of little Lutherans. The place still exists but looks run down. Like many Lutheran churches, its congregation is aging. It will be gone in a generation.",

   "message": "My father was in his early 30s when he served some time in the CDC working as a surgeon's assistant in Afghanistan. His stories of his \\~3 months there were always about how they had to keep recovering patients heavily sedated else they'd try to kill the other people OF OTHER RELIGIONS. The outfit constantly had to ration sedatives  **to keep the patients from murdering each other.** Two of his stories always stuck with me as horribly tragic.\n\n\\~\n\nOne sweltering summer day, on one of the days they'd run out of sedatives, my father was on watch duty \u0026amp; passed out from exhaustion. While he napped, one soldier --who had recently been maimed by a mine blast--wriggled out his arm from his restraints an crawled over to a sharps box and PRIED IT OPEN. He took a scalpel and though he was a 1-legged, 1-armed wreck, maimed and/or killed 7 other patients. The soldier, bleeding this entire time, nearly faints from bloodloss, waking up my father. The soldier puts up horrible racket--summoning several other  nurses that had been nappin nearby. The soldier, screaming about how they had to kill the defilers of Christ \u0026amp; decided to struggle themself to death rather than live with the horrible life they were facing.\n\nTurns out the soldier had, several weeks prior, been on patrol, for his outfit. He saw locals peeing on his outfit's makeshift cross several hundreds of yards away. Blinded by rage, the soldier had run straight towards them but also into a minefield; when he came to, the first thing he associated the other patients with was the people who had defiled the outfit's cross.\n\n\\~\n\nAnother story: A young soldier, on road-construction detail, gets waylaid by locals herding their goats and making a ruckus. The soldier snaps. He took a combat knife \u0026amp; stabbed several CIVILIANS. The civvies, once brought to the surgery outfit, claimed the kid was a \"muslim-hating jew.\" According to the psych-evaluation they processed a week later, the kid was a Jewish-Russian soldier and was dismissed from their tour. This same week, the same injured civilians-on a stroll after nearly a full recovery--attack the *Allah-hating Christian fucks* in a temporary quarantine nearby (again, more civilians) but also exposed themselves to Measles. All of the civilians were given a shot, except for one elderly person who slipped the notice of the overworked staff. The man was later found \u0026amp; confronted in their village, but because the local mullah refused to let the person get a shot, *over 20 children died from a 100% preventable disease*.\n\nThe stories went on and on. No wonder my father suffered horrible trauma from his time as a surgeon's assistant in Afghanistan.",

I just didn't believe it to be true. This was further cemented in my mind as I learned about basic science, just verifying shit with evidence and facts, it just made the whole religion thing seem unreasonable. \n\nNext was in college, I had the Epic of Gilgamesh and then the Bible as required reading. Both books read similarly, and are also similar in how outlandish they are yet one is religious text the other is just some old ass book. Shortly after that I had a Religious Studies class where I learned about hundreds of different religions and I was able to surmise with total confidence religion is just a way to explain unknown phenomenon, and in today's world of information no sane person can employ religion rationally. Also! And this is my favorite theory...religion was used by people in power to control larger groups of people within their sphere and it was at this point in human history, coupled with the advent of agriculture, that humans went from living in small bands to much larger groups and eventually cities! Religion kept people fearful and honest, so religion became a tool of consequence. Its fearmongering helped create civilization as we know it. Fascinating!",

My wife on the other hand was born Seventh Day Adventist, by the time she was the age to get baptized, her parents split. So she was never baptized. The pastor popped a circuit breaker when he found out. He almost backed out. But, since I was born into a prominent family in the area, he made an exception. So, he took all of his vows and voodoo or whatever and chucked it out the window so my family wouldn't be pissed. So, he married an ex Adventist and an Atheist in his church, invoking his deity to bless us, when, by HIS rules, we were both going to hell anyway. It made as much sense to me as that big book everybody quotes but hasn't read. I lost all respect for him, his beliefs, and his religion that day.
