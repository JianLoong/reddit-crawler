 "selftext": " I love the open world, exploring, and just chilling and killing rather than grinding hard in the one optimal xp activity. The recent lowering of open world enemies for higher tier players makes playing in the open world completely pointless as it just tickles your xp bar. I get the push to make the level scaling feel less of a chore and allow players to flex harder, but it just guts any motivation to explore and appreciate the open world content. Simply remove the xp dampening from monsters 3-5 levels below you and we'll be good. Please, make the open world great again. ",
