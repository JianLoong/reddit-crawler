 "selftext": "Seriously. I‚Äôve so far tasted the water in Brisbane (metallic tasting and gross), Perth (somehow dirty tasting), Sydney (just no, oh God no) and Cairns (god tier rainforest runoff with minimal additions because the hippies get butthurt about it) and Melbourne seriously has the best tasting water aside from Cairns, my gleaming gold standard.\n\nWhen I lived in Brisbane having filtered water was absolutely a requirement for good drinking and use in fancy coffee making, but here I‚Äôve never felt the need to filter it or buy bottled water for any reason besides convenience, not to mention for the majority of the year it‚Äôs nice and cold, cold enough to be refreshing but not too cold it‚Äôs annoying.\n\nLooking it up it makes sense to me, it comes from protected catchments and very clean sources, but that still doesn‚Äôt completely explain why it‚Äôs so tasty.\n\nOne day I‚Äôll have to bring some with me back up to Cairns and do a proper side by side taste test, really nail down which one is better as both a drinking water and an ingredient in coffee.",

Mostly because of the catchments but we're just super lucky to have such clean water here. \n\nAs for the taste, that's actually mostly because we don't filter out water as we have no need to - you're probably tasting trace sediments in the water which are actually good for you, if you strip them all out the water tastes... hollow, and fake.\n\nThese sediments do mean though that if pipes get disturbed that the water colour can change from clear to yellow/brown as a result of concentrations of sediment building up in the bottom of pipes - it can be quite jarring and concerning to see happen but nonetheless the water remains safe just a lil funky in appearance (and can affect clothes washing).\n\nWe have a number of key catchment areas so there can be slight variation in the water taste depending on which one/s service you and when we have to make changes to increase supply to meet demand etc. \n\nAlso I will point out that whilst we don't filter water we do still treat it. It has multiple checkpoints for testing and treating starting from the Melbourne Water owned catchments - which go through usually three checkpoints before they come into our (gww) owned pipes where we have our own plans and checks before passing it on to the consumers. There are full reports available publically showing target and achieved water composition for every area in Melbourne so you can check those out on your retailers site if you're curious to know exactly what makes up your water!",

I found the transition from fresh rain water to Cairns tap water really easy. There was little difference. I visited Melbourne recently, and was surprised that such a big city had such nice tap water. I wasn't expecting much from it.\n\nBrisbane tap water: gross aftertaste. Cooked rice with it, and could still taste the water.\n\nTownsville tap water: on par with Brisbane, if not worse.",
