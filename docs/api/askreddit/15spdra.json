Ended up go to different colleges in the same city. Hooked up and went on some dates during our freshman year. Still no labels.\n\nEventually she basically gave me an ultimatum. Said she emotionally couldn‚Äôt do the casual thing anymore. Basically we get back together for real or we go our separate ways. I wasn‚Äôt willing to get back together, but I respected her decision and didn‚Äôt want to toy with her feelings. She wanted to be together, and I knew that any kind of just treating her like a normal friend would have only give her hope. So I basically just cut out all communication.\n\nThat‚Äôs been 8-9 years ago now. She seems to be doing well. Just recently got engaged. She was a good girl, and I‚Äôm happy for her. Wish it didn‚Äôt have to end like it did, because she was cool and I liked spending time with her. But it would have been selfish and emotionally manipulative to do anything besides cut off communication like I did. I have nothing but fond memories of her. I hope she‚Äôd say the same of me.",
