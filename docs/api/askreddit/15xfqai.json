   "message": "The I was playing an online game with a friend in Australia, we were talking about the time difference and how they're a day ahead of the US, and I said, \"Why didn't you warn us about 9/11?!\"\n\nI told this to an adult friend a few days later just as a funny story. She looked at me funny and said, \"I don't get it.\" I tried to explain and she said, \"No, I got the joke, I just don't understand why you picked 9/11 of all things.\"\n\nAfter further discussing our disconnect I realized the problem is that 9/11 doesn't seem like a culturally relevant event to people who weren't alive when it happened.\n\nThe fact that there are grown adults with jobs and apartments out here who didn't exist in a pre-9/11 world kind of kicked me in the guts.",
