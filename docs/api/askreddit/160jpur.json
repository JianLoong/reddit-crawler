Some reasons people might consider dropping out include:\n\n1. **Financial Constraints:** High tuition costs and student loan debt can become overwhelming, making it difficult to continue education.\n\n2. **Personal or Family Health Issues:** Health concerns for oneself or a family member might require a break from college to prioritize care.\n\n3. **Change in Career Goals:** Shifts in career interests and goals might make current coursework feel irrelevant or unnecessary.\n\n4. **Entrepreneurial Pursuits:** Some individuals have strong business ideas and might opt to focus on building their own ventures.\n\n5. **Personal or Family Responsibilities:** Family obligations or personal circumstances could necessitate taking time off from college.\n\n6. **Lack of Interest or Motivation:** If a student is uninterested in their chosen field of study, they might consider leaving to explore other options.\n\n7. **Success Without a Degree:** Some individuals might find that their desired career path doesn't require a college degree to achieve success.\n\n8. **Educational Alternatives:** The availability of online courses, vocational training, or certification programs might make traditional college seem less essential.\n\n9. **Work Opportunities:** Immediate job opportunities that align with career goals might lead someone to pause their education.\n\n10. **Personal Growth and Exploration:** Some individuals might feel that taking time off will allow them to explore personal interests and grow in non-academic ways.\n\nIt's important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks, consider long-term consequences, and explore alternatives before making a decision. Dropping out should be a well-informed choice that aligns with one's goals and circumstances. Seeking advice from mentors, career counselors, and trusted individuals can help in making an informed decision.",

I was also completely burned out on school and struggling with mental health. About 2 years later I enrolled at another college and got a degree that's not very useful and totally irrelevant to my career lol.\n\nIn hindsight I wish I'd gone to community college for my general classes and then transferred to a university. I wish I'd let myself take a break from school without feeling embarrassed or trying to go back as soon as possible. My parents and school were very \"go to college right after high school.\" Anything else was looked down on.",

I ended up playing more wiffle ball then going to some classes. \n\nI went back a few years later and I did allot better, managed 3.9 GPA. Even though I was only 4-5 years older than most of my classmates, I was way more mature than most. I was like them but now I want interested in partying and goofing around, I was trying to get my life moving\n\nI think allot of young people need some time to mature, then again we need to push that NOT going to college is not a bad thing",

   "message": "I bounced in and out of art schools and would basically surf scholarships. I couldn’t afford to go otherwise and I have to say 30 years later I got a LOT out of being in college. Rarely do people ask me about my degree and if they do I tell them the truth. I’ve had a long and successful career and often had people with masters degrees reporting to me. \n\nI think college is incredibly valuable for the things you learn and the connections you make (some of whom I’m still connected to). I don’t think you need to earn a degree to have a positive college experience.",
