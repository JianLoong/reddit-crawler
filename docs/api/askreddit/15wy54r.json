Need something, a listening ear or ....? Often after a loss people are flooded with 'I will be there if you need me' and that is basic. But from experience after a week or so people have moved on and the one with grief is left standing. Those are the times that what you do/say are more important imo.",

That they are not alone, you are there for them any time they need someone. \n\nNot just today but in the days and weeks, even months ahead. The hardest part having been in that awful place can be feeling like you don't want to burden people, or when people start assuming that because you are \"functioning\" normally you've moved on. I had a not very close friend ask, well-meaning but horribly clumsily, if I had got over it now? I just replied no, but I'm getting on with things and I'll be fine. (Then never shared with that person again!)\n\nWorth remembering too that when grieving a loss you can be fine for a while then another wave hits and you can feel completely thrown again. \nJust be there for them, check in regularly while respecting they might also just need some time on their own. \n\nI was so grateful for those that just were a quiet presence (not necessarily even physically, my best friends live back in my home country), sometimes just a phone call or a text makes a big difference. Also depending on your relationship, offer a hug!! That can do a lot of good! \n\nGood luck to you and anyone in this situation, even small efforts at such a difficult time in someone's life can make such a difference when they are hurting and vulnerable.",

   "message": "Keep it simple and how sorry you are. Ask if they need anything. Likely the answer will be 'no' because you can't even think at that point. \n\nAfter that it really depends on how close you are to the person. I will say this from personal experience not just death but any trauma or medical. YOU need to follow up a day or couple of days (this really depends on the situation) when they can at least sort of think and say you want to do something to help and ask them for a specific thing you can do for them. If they can't come up with anything have something planned to say you will do. If you know a food they like say \"I'm going to bring you X on this day/time unless a different day/time works for you\".\n\nI cannot tell you the number of times I've been dealing with really tough stuff and people, when I can't even think, ask what they can do and then I never hear from the again because I can't think or even come up with what they can do and would never call them and be like \"do XYZ\". To be clear these people have no ill will, are good people, are friends and family to this day",
