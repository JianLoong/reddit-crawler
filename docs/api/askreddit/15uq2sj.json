He gave a speech talking about how shy and reserved he was, at 14, and how he hadn't managed to make any friends.\n\nOne day, freshman year, he was heading home when his now best friend (a stranger at the time) stopped him and said he and some buddies were about to play soccer and he was welcome to join them.\n\nHe then said **\"what my friend did not know was that on that day I was heading home to kill myself. I felt so isolated and alone. I had given up. I knew I would never belong. That small act of kindness changed everything.\"**\n\nThe moral of his story was basically that you never know what someone is going through or what your small act of kindness could do for them.",
