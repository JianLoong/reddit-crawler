 "title": "AITA(30F) for not wanting hand me down baby clothes for my kid",
 "selftext": "My(30F) husband(31M) and I are expecting a daughter in January and my sister(25F) has been going crazy about our child. When my sister was 16, she got pregnant by her now husband(27M). It was scary at first, but became something everyone was looking forward to. Unfortunately, the baby was a stillborn. Everyone was devastated, but my sister had never recovered. \n\nShe kept all of the baby clothes they had purchased in preparation for the baby. Recently, she has been kindly asking to give me the baby clothing. I seriously considered it until my sister suggested we name our daughter after hers. She has been very adamant about babysitting the kid frequently and wants to move closer to my husband and I to help with our daughter. \n\nI took this as her wanting to get an experience of having the kid she never had, but I found it extremely creepy. Her husband asked me to not take the baby clothes, because he thinks she’s trying to pretend like our daughter is theirs. He’s tried to bring her back down to earth, but it hasn’t worked, and maybe this will.\n\nThis afternoon, she texted me if I wanted to drop off the clothes. I declined, but she dropped them off anyway. I texted her husband, and he came to pick them, but when she found out she threw a tantrum. She told me I’m being picky because the clothes are slightly odd, and that my pride and ego is too big. She told me she is going to drop them off again, but I threatened to throw them out if she did. She ignored that, and has been telling me to just take the clothes. AITA?",
