 "selftext": "Just by google street view alone, melbourne seems leagues behind when it comes to places like New york or LA. \n\nI know its not fair to compare 2 totally different citys to melbourne, but they both have a certain vibe to them that just screams awsome. \n\nTimes square, for instance, is just soo damn good. Food places, vendors, bustling roads and sidewalks, attention grabbing bill boards!\n\nMelbourne (from what i can tell) has nothing with that kind of charm of vibe to it, other than the really gloomy weather lol.\n\nSo what are yall's fav looking places to check out in the CBD?",
