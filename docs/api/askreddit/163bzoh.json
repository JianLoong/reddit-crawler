And after that I'd just tell them which stocks to buy. \n\n\nAlthough if this is reseach for a book, I'd consider the implications of these moves. For example, my parents are happily married for 30+ years and are one of the few couples in their age range that I know of who are in a truly equal and happy marriage with no drama or resentment. They just enjoy each other's company and love their little flaws. They laugh all the time and have a lot of humor. \nWould their relationship have turned out this way if they had become ultra rich in their late 20s/30s?
