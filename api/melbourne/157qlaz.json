 "selftext": "Just saw a young lass skilfully slip off a tram this morning that was inundated by the badge-wearing ex-school bullies; one of them tried to stop her, but she managed to squeeze through the open door. \n\nNaturally, they check everyone’s card except the clearly ice-affected chap in the corner, who is yelling much too loudly for this time in the morning. A recurring theme. \n\nThey all got off at the next stop, and their plan was to get this young girl on the next tram. The fella who tried to block her was clearly upset that she had managed to evade. \n\nI never really thought about that!\n\nSO! If you do bail when these fucknuts come on the tram, either walk up a stop to avoid them, or let a tram or two pass before jumping on the next one.",
