Her mom had no issues with the age difference but I did. Told them I was uncomfortable with the age difference and the fact I was lied to and that I'm sorry but I have to go.",

   "message": "When I was a kid I had a huge crush on one of my big  brothers friends. They were so cool, worked qnd hung out in the video store, loved mosh pits and gothy stuff. Tall, kinda weird, handsome in am alternative way, etc.Of course I was just the ugly fat little sister of his mate. \n\nA few years later I'd buffed up due to gym etc and he messaged me on Facebook asking if I wanted to get a drink. I was thrilled and  said what about that very night?\n\nI agreed to meet him at a pub in a manky part of town and walked right past the toothless junkie holding up the bar. Of course when he called me over I sat and chatted with him,hoping he was still the same person inside. But he was so edgy and shake, it was like he was barely there. \nI was going to politely leave when another tweaker showed up, his friend, and I didn't know much back then being a lonely stupid fucking teen but the back of my neck was tingling and my brain was just saying *run*.  I excused myself to the bathroom leaving a rather nice jacket behind and squeezed out of the bathroom window. Ended up taking off those stupid clunky gothic heels and running through the streets til I managed to find a taxi rank.\nOddly enough the taxi driver was very kind,  drove me home and wouldn't take any money from  me. We saw each other a few times after that, it never amounted to much but it was nice to see there were still good dudes in the world, considering how that night could have gone.",

I am not judgemental about teeth - I think crooked teeth or gaps can be charming. However, he was missing some teeth, and a couple of the remaining ones were black. He did not look like someone who would have teeth like that, and I was incredibly taken aback. I had to force myself not to stare at his teeth the whole time, and all my attraction evaporated.",

She had a plan to get into that lifestyle too. All I had to do was agree to financially support her and her three young kids since her two exes refused to pay child support. She got loud when I said absolutely not and stormed out.\n\nFriend who set me up swears to this day that she had no idea this woman was like that or even had kids. It's been a running joke between us for many years.",
