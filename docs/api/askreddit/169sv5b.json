There is such a stigma and miseducation about these societal issues that fully makes those suffering feel more worthless than they already feel. At least, that was my experience.  \n\n\nShaming, humiliating, and downright treating people deplorably for issues they never wanted in the first place makes me ill inside. Basic human kindness doesn't seem to apply to those in the trenches of addiction/mental illness. We're the afterthoughts, the lost.  \n\n\nANYBODY can be afflicted with this. I had depression long before I had a drinking problem, which lost me health, a marriage (though ex was always abusive so there's that), and my sense of worth. I was the perfectionist, straight A student, overachiever. I've never tried any other drug (nicotine, weed, nothing) and drank socially until after 30. But after a baby and PPD hitting, my \"addictive\" personality masked itself and before I knew, I'm now an addict (alcoholic, though I prefer someone with a substance abuse disorder). It doesn't run in my immediate family, but signs were there. It was HELL for a few years, I truly wanted to die.   \n\n\nI learned quickly who loved me/accepted me unconditionally and who didn't. Extreme eye-opener, I don't recommend it. I'm now free of a toxic marriage and in-laws that judge everyone else except themselves. People who are just cruel human beings and enjoy the gleeful downfall of others. Same with some friends from that time. It is ugly and disgusts me to my core. Luckily, I've gained compassion, understanding, and support during all this too, but those who supposedly had my back and so cruelly cheered me on to possibly die, they can go to hell.",

It becomes apparent very quickly if you know what to look for.\n\nEver have a conversation with a \"friend\" and it seems like they ignored the last thing you said? It's because they were waiting for their turn to talk. They're not talking with you, they're trying to feed information to you. Usually to manipulate you. These are normally the drama-stirrers too. They'll pretend to be interested in your life for a second, then switch out to \"did you hear about X?\" Because they want YOU to take the fall for calling it out or whatever.\n\nEver have that friend who only ever contacts you when they need something? This is another sign.\n\nEver have that friend who bitches about all their other friends? Yeah they probably bitch about YOU to those friends too.\n\nThese people are self-serving. They never let you get to know the real version of themselves. They're too busy pitting everyone else against each other.
