Not only is the island overcrowded with tourists, but it‚Äôs also overcrowded with western expats and the whole place is totally westernized and inauthentic. \n\nBut the worst part is the total influencer circus that has taken over Bali. Everywhere we went felt like a theme park for Instagram. All those ‚Äôpristine‚Äô and ‚Äônatural‚Äô places you‚Äôve seen photos of? Any waterfall, rice terrace, volcano view, tropical beach, historical temple? They are ALL surrounded by tourist shacks selling Chinese crap, they all have entrance fees to even look, queues upon queues upon queues of people, and the people in the queues doing stuff like getting dressed into long evening gowns (rented from nearby racks) to have an oh so original photoshoot at said location, oh yeah and the locals have built all sorts of cheesy photo platforms/swings/loveseats/nests and big plastic signs everywhere, and selling photo props as well. All tour companies advertise ‚ÄùInstagram tours‚Äù that take you to all the famous IG photo spots and come with a photographer and even a wardrobe. \n\nEven the damn volcano sunrise hike was a traffic jam all the way to the top and then the supposedly beautiful sunrise moment was just a photoshoot bonanza. \n\nMy tip for anyone wanting to visit Indonesia: skip Bali. There are SO many much more incredible places to go. East Java had 100x better waterfalls, temples and volcanoes and 10% of the tourists of Bali, and none of the IG crap. Sumatra (or Borneo) to witness orangutans in the wild, trekking in actual largely untouched jungle. Raja Ampat for truly pristine paradise islands and underwater worlds.
