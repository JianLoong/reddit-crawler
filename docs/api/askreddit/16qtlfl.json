There is a lot of self selection that weeds out all the short guys and leaves all the spots to a select few who possess height.\n\nThis is not to take away from the skill level of those who are playing in the NBA,  it's just that the pool of players taller than 6'4 is 1.1% of the population, it's the average height for a shooting guard and I am guessing from that around 80% of the NBA.\n\nIt probably doesn't match up to individual disciplines of a sport (eg sprinting as an individual discipline of athletics) but as a standalone sport it has the have the strongest selection feature (height) that effectively excludes a large portion of the population.",
