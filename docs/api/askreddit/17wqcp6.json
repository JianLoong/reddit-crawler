Which is the \"oh look women who are as tough as the guys!\" And \"we have diverse cast of characters\" but their race/gender/sexuality etc is their whole character and literally nothing else.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I love the idea of having a strong female character. I love the idea of having Hispanic representation in a cool film. I'd love Trans and nonbinary people get the representation they truly deserve! However if it's only surface level and the writers aren't doing their best to write these characters, these situations, the things we as people go through and do so organically and not beating the audience over the head with \"LOOK AT ME! IM SO SAD BUT SO POWERFUL!\" It's not going to work.\n\nTo get what I'm talking about, look at Arcane.\n\nVi and Caitlin are gay and Caitlin is Asian. Their romance is organic and healthy and is actually very interesting but the show isn't beating anyone over the head about how strong Vi is and how she could likely break your spine without trying. Or how gay they are etc.\n\nNo, we are seeing my just cool characters be cool characters. We watch these women get the shit kicked out of them but have the courage to stand back up and fight back in a believable and organic way. Watch Arcane, you will see what I mean.\n\nThe problems with Hollywood and Disney isn't the \"woke\" thing. It's \"Holy fuck these writers suck ass!\"",
