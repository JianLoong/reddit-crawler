   "message": "If a nuclear bomb goes off without any warning, and you're within the range of the fireball, you wouldn't even have enough time to process what's going on, let alone find a hiding spot, before you're incinerated.\n\nSo the more realistic question would be, if a nuclear bomb goes off and you were luckily far enough away to not be instantly barbecued, where are you hiding from the fallout?\n\nLucky for us, the radioactive fallout from a nuclear bomb has a pretty short half life. You only need to shield yourself from the radioactive dust for about 2 weeks before the radiation decays to relatively safe levels.\n\nIf you're in your car, hopefully you've got enough water in there to survive 2 weeks, because what you'll need to do is close all the windows, stuff the vents to close them off, and hopefully not run out of oxygen in there for the next 2 weeks. Your car almost certainly won't run due to the EMP, so that's about your only choice.\n\nIf you're at home, do the same thing with sealing all the doors and windows. Immediately fill all your bathtubs and sinks and any other containers you can find with water that you'll be using for the next 2 weeks, before your city water gets contaminated. The water in the pipes won't be contaminated yet, but the reservoir water is, so collect as much clean water as you can, while you still can. If you need to let any loved ones into the house who were outside during the blast, strip all their clothes off and leave those outside, immediately wash them thoroughly with soap and water, keep the dirty water and rags/towels you used far away from everyone.\n\nRemember, dust is the big enemy here. Dust is what carries almost all the radiation from the blast, so keep as much outside dust outside as you possibly can.\n\nHopefully you planned for this in advance and you've got potassium iodide tablets everyone can take for the next 2 weeks. A Geiger counter will help you stay away from areas of the house that are unsafe.\n\nGet out some board games, because your electronics are probably all dead, and you're not going anywhere for the next 2 weeks.",

Once I verified that others had gotten the same alert, I then had to think where to hide. First I thought the bathroom? No.. the closet? No.. the hallway? No... I concluded it's an atomic bomb..there's no hiding.. so I got comfy in bed and waited to die.\nWe had been informed the icbm only takes 15 min to get here from North Korea so that's how long we all knew we had to live. In that ppl had to call family to say goodbye.\nI had concluded that unless there's more than one missile I prolly would survive the initial blast as my island prolly wouldn't be a target unlike Oahu.. but my parents were there so I concluded they would die.\nI was worried now about fallout.. and having to survive off what food and water I had... And now having to defend it from my neighbors. \n\nIt was an interesting exercise... Thankfully it was a false alarm\n\nOh I did see video of dads wrenching up drain covers and dropping their children in and replacing the drain cover over them... An interesting strategy. The fathers ran off tho.. not sure where they hid. Id think the blast would still get to the kids thru drainage openings tho.",
