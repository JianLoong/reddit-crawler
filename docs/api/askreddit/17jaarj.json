She had a daughter that was a year younger than me. \n\nShe was an absolute clean freak. I liked her because she would take me places, but she had a lot of rules. Couldn't wear shoes in her house. Ok, not all that weird... but she would take your shoes to the basement utility sink and scrub the bottom of your shoes. Can't have your pants too long, because they might drag on her floor and get dirt on her floor, so I had to roll up my pants. Can't touch the walls, because the dirt from your fingers might get on her white walls. If it was nice outside, you're eating outside, because your crumbs may get on the floor. She was also an English teacher. Even at 6 years old, I couldn't say \"yeah\", you say \"yes\". Only ignorant people say \"yeah\". Can't say I'm going to take off my shoes. \"Only rockets take off. You REMOVE your shoes.\" Couldn't say \"I'm done!\" According to her, \"only turkeys are done. You are FINISHED.\"\"",

Turning it on or off, changing the channel, adjusting the volume or antenna, didn't matter. It had to be done by Dad. And if the father wasn't home or was busy elsewhere in the house, the TV couldn't be used. \n\nAt another, very sheltered, kid's house, the TV wasn't allowed to be turned on before 5pm. I can still remember the mother saying to us \"Television is a nighttime entertainment only.\" The kid in question (this was about first or second grade) was AMAZED when he found out about before and after school cartoons while visiting our house! In fact, he didn't even realize TV stations were on the air before 5pm. His parents didn't let him come over anymore after he apparently told them all about the cartoons we watched at my house...\n\nAt a relative's house, everybody had to be in bed and asleep by 11:00pm. Watching a sporting event or movie that isn't over yet? Too bad, it's bedtime. Wanted to see your favorite comedian guesting on \"The Tonight Show?\" Nope. Still working that Sunday crossword puzzle? You'll have to finish it tomorrow. Major news event happening and you want to keep tabs on the latest reports? Sorry, it's time to sleep. Even if throwing a party for grown adults, and things were fun and lively with cocktails and snacks, all the guests knew to be out of the house by 10:59pm, because by 11:00 it was bedtime for the hosts. Yes, even on New Year's Eve. \n\nLastly, in high school I had a friend whose parents would rearrange the living room furniture every three months so the carpet would wear evenly.",
