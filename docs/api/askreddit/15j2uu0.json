The hard thing for my mother is that she moved to a country away from her extended family and my father didn‚Äôt have any family close. So she was at home all day looking after us. There was a lot of time that things were normal but she would slip up and drink and it would last 2-3 weeks where she would be drunk every day and as a young child I recognised it very quickly. She would come to us in the evening slurring her words and asking us to play games or watch films which actually scared me because I knew she was drunk and I didn‚Äôt want to be near her. It made me sick seeing her become a different person. It broke my heart and kind of broke me. My older brother would start fights with my dad and the whole house would erupt into chaos. Originally I kept running away because I couldn‚Äôt process or stop what was happening. Eventually I began to dissociate sometimes and pretend it wasn‚Äôt happening. But the violence from my brother and father clicked me back into reality and I had to step in. As a young boy I was exposed to the worst types of violence and threats which did benefit me in a way as I never took shit from people at school and never felt threatened by bullies because compared to my brother they were nothing. There was choking, broken bones, fists flying, threats of being stabbed and killed.\n\nIn terms of my mother she eventually admitted herself after she almost ran away with another man and realised she needed help. She has been sober for over a decade and worked incredibly hard to make up for what she did and caused. So whilst I still remember and feel for everything that happened, I‚Äôve come to learn that she was simply someone who became lonely and desperate and wanted to escape but couldn‚Äôt control her addiction.

Ended up marrying a woman who really loved chaos and enabled him.  When I was about 11 she let me know that he wasn't ever actually an addict my mom just made him really unhappy. At that point,  he did a weird thing though, he starting drinking occasionally but I never saw him drink to excess after that.  Almost like he could control it, which went against EVERYTHING I've ever learned.  I did Ala Teen and they told me it was impossible.  BUT his behavior/personality was 100000% an addict.  Nothing was his fault, everything and everyone was making him a victim.   He was an incredibly toxic and traumatizing person.  BUT he grew up with a violent alcoholic father.  His life growing up was horrible.  When I became a mother and my kids were older, I saw the life they lived and compared to the life he lived and it broke my heart.  He didnt even have a chance.  So I was able to find empathy for that terrified little boy who had no safe place to go ever and forgive the man he became.  \n\nThat being said, forgiving someone who isn't sorry is incredibly hard.     I cut him out of my life about 15 years ago and didn't forgive him until quite a few years after that and still don't have him in my life.  My forgiveness is for my own well being, not his.

I am at another family, I don't know about my half sister.\n\nI can't quite be mad at her, she is the reason i am not already in a dept, since she doesn't care about me, nor does her family. Also, she seemingly stopped drinking and smoking early enough, so that I am not phyiscally disabled.",

Luckily my mom was there for me and we got out of the worst of it when I was young, but I didn‚Äôt build a relationship with him for years and years. I still rarely see him and have never lived with him, but I have the perspective now to see that the drinking only ruined his own life and he basically had to pick up the pieces from the beginning. My heart really goes out to him and every other person struggling with alcoholism because it truly is a disease, not something as easy to do as ‚Äújust stop drinking‚Äù.",

I loved him and knew he loved us, but when he was drinking he was the worst version of himself.\n\nI, in turn became a drug addict.\n\nIt was only when I got in recovery did I realize not only were there valid reasons I turned to drugs, there were even more reasons for him. He had a horrific childhood an seen some shit.\n\nI forgave him because I understood his addiction like my own.",

We will have to grieve the father who maybe cared but never cared enough and never bothered to do better for us. I know that I will also feel guilty about not having much of a relationship with him because I had to distance myself‚Ä¶ so I anticipate his death being a very interesting mental battle. And I‚Äôll struggle to forgive him for that too.",
