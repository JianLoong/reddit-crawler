You're fat because you eat too much!\"\n\nEventually she relented, I got the bloods but she told me the tests were negative.\n10 years later at another GP I got retested. Not only was my hypothyroidism very severe they found the original test which also showed it as serious.\nShe lied to save face and ruined my life and my chosen career path (RAF).\n\n*EDIT* thanks for all your kind comments, it's been very validating. To answer a couple of questions yes, as far as the weight goes I'm ok. Once the correct medication was prescribed I was able to start losing weight and so far I've lost 5st (70lbs). I still need to get rid of more but it's not easy. This meant I could start doing things that had been impossible to me all my life. I took up MMA, did my first 5K, I can fit on rollercoasters and in airplane seats. \nThe crippling depression and anxiety are under control and I'm feeling positive about life.\nSadly I was unable to bear children due to the mess my body was in when I was young enough, so now my husband and I are living our dream of travelling to far off places.\nYou make the best of it.\nNo, I didn't sue.\nI saw her once a few years later.

I'll try to list some.\nAge 11, experiencing chronic pain and fatigue, Dr said it was attention seeking, which made my family teachers etc ignore it.  It was ankylosing spondylitis which wouldn't be dx for 25 years because of that Dr. Same Dr said that I met the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome but that she didn't believe in it (1990 Australia) and offered no treatment.  Same Dr then said it was depression and prescribed me anti depressants without any education for my admittedly useless parents. They left me to it and within 2 weeks of starting the pills I attempted suicide having not been depressed before. I never took any anti depressants after that and neither my parents nor Dr even asked how the pills were going, never knew about the attempt, and never tried to refill my script.  Still returning to same shit Dr, age 13 she referred me to a rheumatologist.  At this point I had been in the kind of debilitating pain that adults are on fentanyl patches for, for 2 years, with no help.  Rhumy did tests and diagnosed me with something that is essentially a precursor to ankylosing spondylitis BUT didn't explain this to my parents or gp, and I felt relief and hope and grief when hearing j had a DX and teared up. Rhumy said \"I don't know why you're crying, you don't have cancer\".  He told my family there was no treatments for it and my mother took the dx to be a none dx. This all set me up for a life of hellish pain unmanaged and trauma and mistrust of people and shame. \n\nCut to age 16. Start having sex. Go to Dr for the pill. First Dr tells me women can't fall pregnant if they don't orgasm (Catholic Dr, 13 kids).  Fall pregnant, want an abortion. Second Dr won't refer for abortion until I have an u/s.  I see 8week heartbeat on screen and decide to keep. At 16 yrs old. This was Drs goal.  Third Dr, ob/gyn gets me to strip completely naked every single appt, does internals and breast exams every appt, I didn't know he was sexually assaulting me until I was pregnant with my second a decade later and nobody wanted to do these things.  Needed emergency C-section, during the operation, my obgyn and the surgeon were literally discussing how nice it was to work on a young body, it was disgusting. \n\nAll this by 16.. I'm in my 40s. I'm gonna stop because it's all triggery.  But it goes on throughout my life. But yea I have some disdain for general practitioners and some specialists tbh.",

(Baby in the fallopian tube, 0% chance for baby, very small chance for myself to live if not taken care of) I was told to go to the ER if I developed severe pain.\n\nI developed severe pain and went to the ER. The doctor on call sat there and tried to casually discuss what kind of pain meds I might like TO MY HUSBAND as I was writhing in pain on the bed. Husband insists doc should just make a decision and give me the meds now. Finally gave me a pain pill and told me no need for an ultrasound, just did some bloodwork for my file. I go home and wait it out with a script for pin meds. I told him the pain was severe and could be the tube bursting and he told me that miscarriages just hurt. \n\nI went into the gyno treating me 2 days later and he took one look at me and booked me for emergency surgery. The tube had burst and I had so much internal bleeding that they had to have a general surgeon assist in the cleanup in my abdomen. My bowels were adhering to the broken tube and had to be carefully separated. \n\nLater, my doc told me I was very lucky and the moron at the ER should have sent me in to an ultrasound based on the pain alone. The blood work was apparently alarming.\n\nWent back for an IV to the same shitty ER a few months after. That same shit ER doc checked my abdomen and saw the surgery scars. He commented I must have recently had an operation! I told him \"yeah, you misdiagnosed my burst ectopic pregnancy and I had to get emergency surgery at a different hospital.\" He didn't say shit after that.
