I love those two kids more anything and wouldn't change a thing as far as me stepping up to raise them. BUt what ruined my life is my sister's herion addiction and the fact she had two kids she couldn't raise because of her addiction forcing me at 17 to step up and be a parent to her two kids. Today I am 35 years old and they are teenagers. One is almost finished high school but having to raise them really stunted my life and made me sacrifice so much because my sister couldn't be a mother. There I said it. My sister ruined my life. Now with that all said. I love my kids. I would never have abanoned them and not be there for them but being parent to kids I didn't bring into this world has been a challenge of a lifetime. Parenting is no joke. You always feel like you are failing too. Its tough... I love them more anything in life though and would never have chosen differently.",

I told him today that I don't want to move and the conversation went so badly; he was upset and understand why but I feel like he doesn't have sympathy for my position. I feel like I want this baby but abortion is the only way to avoid having a long, horrible legal battle. I don't want abortion to be part of my life. I don't think there's any way for me to get through this without regretting my decision, whatever it ends up being.",
