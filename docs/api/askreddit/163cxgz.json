I stopped casually dating \u0026amp; hooking up. I was in a really bad place and I was getting with practically anything that walked. I was active sometimes 4 times a week with different people. \n\nHow I never contracted anything is beyond me. But I just so desperately wanted to be wanted even if it meant laying with someone I half knew for a half hour. Gross I know. Not the act, but the principle of my situation at least. \n\nVoluntary? At first no. After I had kinda situated myself out of constant hookups, I sorta sat in my mental state. I knew if I wanted to, all I had to do was go through my phone and just pick someone to message, and if they were busy I had the backup. But it started to make me feel so gross, that I just decided not to have sex until someone actually wanted me for me and not just to get off. \n\nI sorta had this epiphany *that should be obvious, and unfortunately it‚Äôs not* that while it felt good, I didn‚Äôt feel good. I was essentially allowing myself to be used and training myself to be okay with it, because I wanted the counterpart to be okay. \n\nThat‚Äôs just my own personal situation, but if you have a body, you do whatever you think is best for *your* body. \u0026lt;3",

The first five years I was taking care of my elderly father, then mourning his death, then lockdown‚Ä¶ Still trying to figure out how to have a life after all of that. Caring for my dad also did a number on my career so that‚Äôs been my focus since losing him. It‚Äôs so much easier to think when I‚Äôm not stressing about romance or hookups.\n\nWeirdly I do have a high sex drive but this drought hasn‚Äôt been difficult for me. I can handle things just fine myself.",
