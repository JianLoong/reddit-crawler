   "message": "I did the night audit at a hotel. 3rd shift, and no one else was there all night.  One evening I had my then girlfriend (this was the year 2000) stop by, and we had sex in the managers office. The next day, I get called in, and she pulls up video of me getting a blowjob in her chair! As I was sitting there, right next to her, and she was sitting in the same chair.  I was a young, couldn't care less punk kid back then. The manager said \"you know we have to let you go, right?\", right after telling me they had installed cameras all over a week prior. I swear she liked the video a little too much, she didn't look mad at all. And as she let it play,  her eyes didn't leave the screen. AWKWARD!!!! She kept letting it play as she was talking to me about the situation. \n I was a young, 23 year old guy, she was a middle aged unmarried lady. I asked for a copy of the tape before leaving.",

Coworker told me I needed to change my school schedule \u0026amp; I said no. She ended up starting rumors which I decided to ignore \u0026amp; she told the manager to fire me. So the manager did.
