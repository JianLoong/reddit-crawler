   "message": "Ignaz Semmelweis and his work on hand hygiene and infection control in the mid-19th century.\r  \n\r  \nIgnaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician who worked in the maternity wards of the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s. He observed that there were significantly higher rates of maternal mortality from childbirth fever in the ward where medical students and doctors conducted autopsies before attending to pregnant women. In contrast, the midwives' ward, where there was no direct contact with autopsies, had much lower mortality rates.\r  \n\r  \nSemmelweis hypothesized that there was some sort of \"cadaverous particles\" carried by the doctors from the autopsy room to the maternity ward, causing the spread of infections. He introduced a strict handwashing protocol using chlorinated lime solution before examining patients, and the mortality rates in the doctors' ward dramatically decreased.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Semmelweis faced strong resistance from the medical community of his time. His theories challenged the prevailing medical dogma and were met with skepticism and even ridicule. His ideas were not widely accepted during his lifetime, and he suffered both personal and professional hardships.\r  \n\r  \nDespite his contributions, it took several more decades for the medical community to fully understand the importance of hygiene and infection control. The work of Semmelweis eventually laid the foundation for the modern understanding of germ theory and paved the way for the adoption of proper sanitation practices in medical settings.\r  \n\r  \nWhile Semmelweis did not receive the recognition he deserved during his lifetime, his efforts had a profound impact on shaping the future of medicine and saving countless lives through the prevention of infections.",

Now there's a Republican majority and Roe v Wade is abolished (among other new developments).",
