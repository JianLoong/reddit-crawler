   "message": "\n\nLong one this one. Buckle up‚Ä¶.\n\nWe‚Äôd been friends since school - well over 25 years. I‚Äôd been seeing my girlfriend (now wife) for a year or so and we‚Äôd been invited to a wedding of one of her oldest friends who was back to the UK from Australia for a short period to get married. They hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a few years and so she was thrilled to get an invite to see her friend and introduce me etc. We lived in the Midlands and the invite was Cambridge way. \n\n6 days after we‚Äôd confirmed our attendance we got a wedding invite through the door for a mutual friend of me and my bestie - a old school pal of ours who we both saw regularly. The wedding was for the same date as the other event. I had no prior knowledge that this would be the case. \n\nFactoring in we were originally down to attend the wedding service and reception for my wife‚Äôs friend, we thought we‚Äôd try and do our utmost to not offend either party by suggesting the following: \n\nGo to my girlfriend‚Äôs friends wedding service in Cambridge and then race back to the Midlands to attend the Reception and evening ‚Äòdo‚Äô for my friends big day. Having confidently suggested this perfect solution to my friends prospective wife (when she chased for an idea of who was attending) I was told in no uncertain terms that we were ‚Äú‚Ä¶either there for the whole day or not at all‚Äù. I was gobsmacked. We were doing our best to make both parties happy (including going back on our originally agreed full day attendance at my girlfriends‚Äô friends wedding) to try and this was how we were being treated! \n\nI rang my bestie up - confident he would agree with the ridiculous posturing from our mutual friends prospective wife. Instead of being backed to the hilt, my friend told me he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get involved‚Äù and whilst he understood what I was saying he countered that with a suggestion that I go to my friends wedding and my girlfriend attended her friends wedding - problem solved supposedly. \nI couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing for the second time that day. I told him we‚Äôd bent over backwards to be kind to both sets of people - especially when we‚Äôd had my friends invite almost a week after the other invite, but he just wasn‚Äôt having it and didn‚Äôt want to get involved (he was best man for our friend). I told him how disappointed I was in him and thought he‚Äôd see how ridiculous his stance was. \n\nWe didn‚Äôt speak for 12 months. I went for the full day at my girlfriends friends wedding and it was lovely. I felt a massive pang of bitterness towards my friend and our mutual friend (who ultimately was too weak to stand up to his prospective wife and overrule her pettiness. I‚Äôd known him for 25 years and her casually 2 years at this point).\n\nIt was a painful year away from my friend. On the anniversary of us last speaking I could take it no more. I emailed him simply with the words ‚ÄúI think a year is long enough‚Äù. He agreed and we slowly rebuilt bridges to get back stronger. We agreed to disagree on the matter but vowed not to go over old ground and look forward. I do still feel bitterness about the situation as it wrecked the relationship I had with our mutual friend. That has never recovered - even though we occasionally exchange pleasantries if we‚Äôre out in the same group. \n\nMe and my best mate simply realised our lives were enriched with each other in them - and simply had to overcome our disagreement. I‚Äôm glad to say our friendship - some 15 years or so after the event - is stronger than ever.\n\nTL:DR - Fell out with best friend over mutual pal wedding snub. Now repaired friendship.\n\nEDIT: Thought it worthy to add (after reading some of the delightful comments üòè) that I didn‚Äôt fall out with my friend because he didn‚Äôt get involved and / or speak to the couple to intervene. I never asked him to. We fell out because I was disappointed that he didn‚Äôt have an opinion when I asked him if me and my girlfriend were being unreasonable in our attempts to please both sides. I felt, rightly or wrongly, that our 25 years of friendship would allow him the comfort to have an opinion on such a matter - whatever it was. The irony is that we wouldn‚Äôt have fallen out if he‚Äôd have told me his opinion - good or bad. I regret falling out and in the manner we did.",

If we weren't playing basketball together, we were hanging out playing video games, going to parties, getting into typical teenage mischief. Once we got to our final year of high school, he broke his leg really bad and missed the entire season. He had a scholarship offer that was withdrawn after his injury. He became depressed and started ghosting me. He started hanging out with older \"gangsters\" from his community and started dealing drugs, then dropped out of high-school (he had about 2 months before graduation). \n\nAfter high school, I went to university on an athletic scholarship and lost almost all contact with him. I would run into him a handful of times while I was in undergrad, usually at a nightclub. He would be wearing designer clothes and dropping a couple thousand dollars in cash on bottle service/drinks surrounded by his crew. He would always com6e say hi to me and buy me a drink, or invite me to his table, but it just wasn't the same. He had changed so much from the person I knew. \n\nHe wound up getting caught in a police sting operation targeting the Hells Angel's. He got caught on video/audio selling a couple of kilograms of cocain to an informant. He was sentenced to 4 or 5 years of jail, if I remember correctly. I haven't spoken/seen him since. I have friends who still live in the city where this all took place, and they see him around every once in a while since he got out of jail. They never had a chance to speak with him, but apparently, he drives around in a rather expensive Mercedes. I have no idea if he turned his life around or his still up to his old games.",
