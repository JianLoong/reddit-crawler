 "selftext": "Doggo still alive btw, this happened 4 years ago \u0026amp; I ended up adopting him. He just turned 17 \u0026amp; the incident was brought up again this past weekend.\n\nSo my sister‚Äôs son was learning to walk \u0026amp; fell on the dog who was asleep. What felt like a reaction time of a millisecond the dog bit their son on his cheek \u0026amp; dog was kicked out of the house while sister \u0026amp; her husband took their son to urgent care to receive 1-2 stitches on his cheek \n\nWhen they came back dog was still waiting outside the house but instead of bringing him back in \u0026amp; keeping him separated, discussing it with family/friends, exploring other alternatives, they dropped him off at a shelter nearby \u0026amp; when the employee asked what they could help with, the husband said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, he bit my son, you can euthanize him, whatever, we don‚Äôt care‚Äù \u0026amp; drove home\n\nMy sister told me a day after doggo was dropped off at the shelter what happened \u0026amp; verbatim i asked ‚Äúfirst and foremost is [her son‚Äôs name] okay?‚Äù After listening to her vent i then asked ‚Äúdo you know if [dog‚Äôs name] is still alive? I wish I knew sooner i would‚Äôve adopted him, I‚Äôm going to the shelter now to see if he‚Äôs still alive‚Äù\n\nWe didn‚Äôt speak for months because of this. They claim i care more about the dog than their son. They say that because i do not have children of my own i could never understand what they went through \u0026amp; therefore fail to realize the choice they made was a reasonable one\n\nI argue that although i dont have any children of my own, i can still understand \u0026amp; empathize the upset, anger, \u0026amp; fear they must‚Äôve felt, but to ditch the dog all alone in a shelter they had for his whole life (13 years) over a mistake is absurd to me because there shouldve been other options explored before euthanizing \n\nDog is small breed, 15 lbs at most, never had an aggressive incident like that before or after\n\nSo, AITAH for failing to see it from their POV?\n\nPS fast forward to today there is no scar on the kid, \u0026amp; he is not traumatized by the dog. He will ask for the dog when i come to visit \u0026amp; feed him treats. Took awhile for me to feel comfortable bringing the dog around but it was roughly a year after the incident \u0026amp; because sister insisted it‚Äôs behind them. Everything was chill until this past weekend sister‚Äôs husband brought it up \u0026amp; got all sassy with me. He claims everyone he shares the story with totally agrees with his actions in wanting to euthanize because the child comes first \u0026amp; i called him out on being rash \u0026amp; using the ‚Äúi have a child/im a parent‚Äù card to excuse their extreme measures \u0026amp; reactions\n\nPSS if my sister‚Äôs husband is reading this, i still think you‚Äôre a huge üê±",

Dog stayed with my parents for a couple of months but we have her back with us now with much stricter rules around to stop it happening again.

Daughter is fine, still loves the dog but gives her space and dog will remove herself to another room if she feels overwhelmed",

My mom and I feed stray cats in our locality ,  we are doing so for years ,everyday 8-10 cats come to our house to eat three times a day and some of them even like to sleep in our house during the day and some little ones even became our family member because either their mothers died or their mother gave birth in our house. My mom has been bitten by cat once because she didn't see a cat was sleeping on floor and stepped on her tail , I have been bitten and severely scratched to the point of going to hospital,  once I was scratched because the cat felt like I needed a red tattoo in my leg I guess and had to go to hospital, another time I was scratched because the kitten thought my hand was a nice place to sharpen his nails , diva cat I guess and off to hospital I went ,and the third time it was a cloudy day lights were off and I couldn't see a pregnant cat was sleeping on our floor and I stepped on something of her I still don't know to this day what did I step on ,and she bit me directly in a vein on my toe, this one was severe because the poison directly went to my blood  according to doctors,doctors gave me five injections on the spot , and there were other sceduled for later dates, the on the spot injections included two injections on my toe, one of them was a big injection( the injection was so huge I can still see it in my nightmares) directly to a bone in my leg  , the injection was bent when doctors pull it out ,so you can guess it hurt like hell , my leg was so swollen that I couldn't walk for two days , another one was injected directly through the spot where the cat bit.  But the cute thing is, the cat mama came back to our house  next day  amd sneak in through our window  to see if I was still alive , how generous of her , I love her so much üò≠, unfortunately she died a year later  and now her son is my mom's adopted son and his daily routine is to bite and scratch me gently, oops I went way off track.\n  Anyways my point is after getting injured by cats so many times we are still feeding them all to this day, my mom allocates a portion of her budget every month for the cats and they aren't even our pet cats, how can your sister and SIL be so heartless to abandon the poor doggo just because of a little mistake? I thought pets are like children to people , how can they even think about killing the dog just because it bit their child once?
