Called my roommate for a ride, he offered to get me himself since she had a paper due.\n\nHe kissed me tentatively in the car. I saw fireworks and kissed him back harder.

The moment I got married and started wearing my wedding band the amount of women who approach me and openly flirt with me is staggering.\n\nI think part of it is forbidden fruit aspect, wanting something that's already taken. I think the other part is that people find commitment attractive. The idea that I've found my wife and only want to be with her for the rest of my life is what they want from a partner so they're unconsciously drawn to someone who appears to be good at commitment. They don't usually see the logical flaw that if they managed to get me, I'd be bad at commitment.",
