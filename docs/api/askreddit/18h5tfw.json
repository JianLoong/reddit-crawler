In the 1850s, Britons spent **80%** of their income on eatables and drinkables.\n\nMalthus be damned, in spite of a colossal increase in world population, in the 1st \u0026amp; 2nd worlds almost everybody has access to 2500 plus calories per day.  Naturally, a lot of it is unhealthy fats and sugars, but even poor people can afford to be overweight.\n\nNaturally, this does not apply to *everyone* worldwide, but on the whole, the specter of famine has receded.  95.7% of the world's population is **not** faced with the real possibility of death through inanition or pure hunger.\n\nEven the synonym for money \"Bread\" is no longer in common usage.",

And it was a male oriented sidescroller, shooter, sports game, Jrpg, or platformer.\n\nBut now there is so much variety and quality titles being released with so many options for inclusion.\n\nYou can have games about cooking, games about sussing out which one of you is an alien, games about grief and loss, games about driving a truck, AND even more games which generic brown haired white male lead. Games that offer so much customization and variety that everyone gets to feel represented.\n\nSteam is an awesome platform. Has a great refund policy, provides a free platform for multi-player gaming, has a handheld console that is great, and has so many games that often go so deeply discounted that ppl complain that a game is \"only 75% off\".\n\nGaming used to be this niche hobby that you grew out of. Now there's a game for everyone out there and hopefully even more on the way.",
