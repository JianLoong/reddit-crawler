   "message": "She was unvaccinated and refused to take a covid test before seeing me. My mother was terminally ill and severely immuno-compromised, so I was absolutely trying to minimise the risk of getting covid so I could still see my Mum.\n\n\nShe refused to take a test, twice, despite kind and calm requests and explanations, on the basis that she \"didn't want to get a sinus infection.\" (This was in the time of nasal swabs, not mouth swabs, for covid tests. You know, those nasal swabs that are sterile and can't cause infection.)\n\n\nI'm 100% sure that it wasn't about a sinus infection. It was about control. She had been annoyed because I hadn't validated her anti-vax stance in the past.\n\n\nSimilarly, I know she wanted more validation for her religious views, which she'd acquired in her 30s and which I didn't share. I'd told her that I was happy her faith made her happy, but I think she wanted me to truly share her beliefs. I'd also said that her sister's bisexuality was \"fine with me\" when she'd stated that a wedding of 2 women was \"not what God wants.\"\n\n\nI think all of those different views just threatened the way she saw the world, and how she saw herself.\n\n\nHer last texts thanked me for \"sharing my views\" re covid and it's potential to kill my Mum, then became pseudo-concerned when I didn't reply. I read the whole situation as \"I want to say whatever I want to you, but I want to still feel like a nice person, so please reply and give me that validation.\"\n\nI didn't reply to her, but I still ask myself whether the mature thing to do would have been to clearly reply and state that I didn't want to stay in contact. It's taken me until now (over a year later) to see through the pain and formulate what I might have said.\n\nWe'd been friends since the first days of high school. 20+ years. In essence we just aquired very different views from each other as adults, but I can't pretend her attitude towards my Mum, and towards the horrible journey my family had to take, wasn't devastating.\n\nLife is a bloody painful journey at times, that's for sure.",

   "message": "Was really good friends with this chick for 13 years. She started getting serious with her current boy friend like 3 years ago. She had a stroke and I went to see her. I texted her a week or so after, she never responded. I texted her merry Christmas a few weeks later, she never responded. A few weeks later, I wished her a happy birthday.  She again didn't respond.  I figured she was just going through her typical relationship, where she drops off the face of the earth for a bit and so I have her space.  A year goes by and again, I wish her a happy birthday via text... no response. I figured she just grew apart. Her sister texts me that July saying she doesn't know what happened between my friend and me but asked if I could reach out.  I explained what I've experienced then she stops responding. Two months ago my friend posted a rare snap chat and I messaged her saying I missed her and hope she's alright. She messaged me a few hours later telling me \"you stopped talking to me\". I have a text with time stamp and no reply. I was going to send it to her and try to defend myself but I figured it would just be drama. I've tried reaching out, she never did, but blames me. Frustrating, a little disappointing,  but just dumb. As good of and long of a friendship we had I would think I'd get a friendlier response",

I showed up when her stalker ex was waiting outside a school building for her once.\n\nShe got long covid. And has a history of shitty parents doing shitty things and illnesses she's only now getting to figuring out. I was there for all that too. I worried like crazy when she got covid. Her texts got more and more sparse. She told me she wasn't feeling like being sociable and that she likely wouldn't be hanging out anytime with any one. So I worried about that too. I knew she wouldn't show but I tried to help her invited to things and keep checking in. \n\nFound her going to events with a mutual friend on social media. \n\nI feel like a convenience friend. I was only ever there for her to dump her shit on basically. Sucks. She never came to our apartment. Then I got married, no congrats. Didn't come to see our house when we bought one, or meet our new puppy. It just makes me so upset that I put so much time and effort and care in and received basically nothing. If she didn't want to be friends, I'd rather she'd just told me.",

After a few drinks, I went upstairs into my\nRoom and went to bed after telling her she could take the spare bedroom. And that‚Äôs exactly where I stayed. I Was nowhere near drunk, mainly because I am not a fan of hard liquor despite having a high tolerance for it. \nThe next morning, she was getting ready to leave, hugged me goodbye and thanked me for hanging out. Later that day I received a barrage of texts from her accusing me of the SA. After reading the texts, I simply told her that if she truly believed I could do that to her that it‚Äôs best if we never spoke again. \nFor a little back story, this person might as well have been my older sister. We‚Äôve known eachother since we were preteens. she‚Äôs been through hell and back. To boil\nIt down, let‚Äôs just say she‚Äôs the kind of person where you have to be careful with what you say and do otherwise you‚Äôll send her into a ptsd attack. \nHowever, despite this she refused to seek out help, and would excuse poor behavior for her past. I loved her dearly I truly truly did, but I refuse to be around a person who only wants to play victim and expects the world to bend to their needs and wants. \nI don‚Äôt hate her, I only hope that she realizes what she‚Äôs doing isn‚Äôt healthy and is costing her people that actually care.",
