The new ones are always dried out anyway and taste too much of a homestyle flavor. I’ll go to an actual restaurant for that. Now I only order them without salt so I can have the freshest batch. (Less likely to be dried out.)\n\nI’ve asked Wendy’s several times on twitter to do a special “Wendy’s Yellow” event just because I want to taste those fries again, but no luck.

   "message": "Crazy how so many of these are from McDonald's. Mine is actually the salad in a cup from McDonald's.  In the late '90s, they had grilled chicken salad and chicken Caesar salad in a cup. You could shake it up and just eat. It was so convenient and delicious. Definitely miss those. There was also a burger around that time that was awesome too. Their version of a patty melt. They had Caraway rye hamburger buns and caramelized onions. God those burgers were so good.",

They canned it and replaced it with a thoroughly generic chicken sandwich that's largely indistinguishable from McDonald's (which is low tier IMO).\n\nMcDonald's spicy chicken nuggets are one of the better nuggets I've had. There's just something about the crispiness of the batter that the other fast food places can't match with their more crumbed nuggets, and spiciness just seals the deal. (BK currently has nuggs that are tossed in a fiery chili sauce right now though that are pretty bomb)\n\nCulver's is a midwestern burger chain, and a couple of times they've had a very limited time special \"Curderburger\" which has a fried cheese curd patty on a burger, 10/10 no notes except that it should be a regular thing instead of like one week a year.",
