Me and one of my coworkers had a system running that he would be on the roadside cutting and loading the trailer, and I  would unload back at the burn pit. We'd meet halfway on the road, pull over, and swap vehicles to keep pace going. We'd been running hard and were super excited about how many loads we were getting, cause that was gonna give us a big payday coming. Anyways, we had been running that system all day with not a blip. On our second to last load, we met on the roadway, and he came over to my side to swap. We chatted for a second, and he realized he'd forgotten his smokes in the other truck, so he was gonna come back across the road with me and grab them. I saw a truck coming. It seemed further away than it was, I thought(?) he saw it too, but I guess not. I hesitated, and he turned and went to bolt across the road, hesitated, and then took a couple of steps and bam. He was hit by the truck, which was doing at least 50 to 60 mph. Never, for as long as I live, will I ever forget seeing his body tossed into the air up over the back of the truck bed like a ragdoll and slam into the ground. I will never forget that sound, ever. He was barely more than an arms distance from me when he was hit, and I felt the impact in my bones. I ran over and sat on the ground and pulled him into my lap, and I could see he was gone. I just started screaming and rocking him. The guy that hit him had pulled over and come running to offer aid. He was gone, though. I think he probably died on impact, and I hope so honestly. I've been through some traumatic shit, but nothing tops that. I have ptsd from it. I'm scared to cross roads or to allow others to do so. Even writing this now, tears are streaming, and I feel panicky. I will never truly be over it, I don't know how someone could ever erase that from memory. But I sure wish I could. \n\nRIP Fred N.",

I was upset, but corporate wanted to get together some grief counseling options before disclosing to the team. I had to sit on the info for two days.\n\nBecause I was off the day they were going to tell the department, one of the store managers sat me down to tell me the next morning. I insisted I already knew. He insisted I didn't. We closed the door, I asked \"is this about C? Because M already let me know.\" Manager says \"oh. So you do know.\" I sobbed for a good ten minutes while the manager scrambled to console me as I choked out \"it's. Not. Your. Fault. I'm o-o-o-o-kay.\"\n\nI was told that our team took it hard. Some of my night people tried to lie and tell me they were doing well. I told them to cut the crap and they admitted they were pissed and grieving. Another manager tried to give one of my shift leads a problem because she wasn't handling things well for the first shift we were all together and got politely told to fuck off by me. \n\nI backed off of my team for a little while, especially at night, and everyone had a really hard time adjusting to it. He was really well liked, and we both used to have one another laughing all the time. I still miss the dude, and I haven't worked there for over a year.",

The first person was a good friend of mine in his early 20’s. He came from a rough background and when I met him he was strung out on meth but I watched him get clean and sort his life out. He was honing his craft at work and being a better father for his kids but the fun thing with addiction is most people never beat it, they just trade substances. He started drinking more heavily but never let it get so bad he couldn’t work so I never realized it was as bad as it was. One night he goes out partying and asks me to join, I couldn’t make it because I had out of town obligations and told him I’d see him when I got back to town. That night he was in a solo accident and died at the scene and that’s something I’ve had to hold onto ever sense. The next person was a hard ass in his late 20’s with a similar story that had a shut up and get it done mindset for himself and everyone around him. He may have been abrasive but he was a damn good person at the end of the day and cared for everyone around him. Same story, although some allege a mechanical failure in his car I know the truth. Third person was a talented but troubled man in his 30’s that pushed me every day to be better than I was the day before which I had never experienced. I don’t know what was broken in him but he never allowed himself to accept his own accomplishments and drank away all of his failures even if they weren’t actually his. He became fixated on the idea that “death’s come in three’s” and drank himself to death because none of us had the courage to have a hard conversation with a hard man. I think about these people daily and if you don’t know what it’s like to look around a room full of your peers and fear who’s next I envy you. When you see the signs, please say something. Reach out.
