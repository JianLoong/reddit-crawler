 "selftext": "I've got a bit of a specific curiosity :)\n\nAre there any folks who used to live in any of the Nordic countries and have since made permanent move to Melbourne? I'd love to hear about your experiences!\n\nCould you please share:\n\n\\- What motivated your move to Melbourne?\n\n\\- How does life here compare to your previous home in the Nordics?\n\n\\- Are you enjoying your life in Melbourne or do you ever regret the move?\n\nCurrently I live \u0026amp; work in Denmark (as an expat), and I do like it here:\n\n\\- Work-life balance is amazing!\n\n\\- Public transport is top-notch\n\n\\- I feel completely safe here walking around even during the night.\n\nBut I do miss the big city vibe (I'm in my 30s, no kids), and Melbourne seems like the closest thing to a Nordic city, but with more diversity and events happening. Or is my impression deceptive?",
