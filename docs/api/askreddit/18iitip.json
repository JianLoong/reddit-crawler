Find your gas meter and know how to shut it off.\n\nMake sure your address is clearly visible from the street. Get a lightup sign if you can. Not only does it save UPS/FedEx from misdelivering your stuff and helps your friends find your home, but helps police/firedepartment find your house.\n\nThen;\n\nMake sure every room has a smoke detector. Carbon Monoxide detectors for every bedroom.\n\nFire extinguishers for kitchen, and  garage at leas, then extras near every exit.  \n\n\nNOTE: Place your fire extinguishers at the doors. If there is a fire, run to an exit and then decide when you're at the exit if you can fight it with the extinguisher or not. If you think you can, then grab the extinguisher and go fight it. Do not get trapped between the fire and the exit. If your extinguisher is not at an exit then it leaves you having to decide on the spot if you should go for the extinguisher or the exit... if you choose the extinguisher and it's not at an exit and you were wrong, then you may be in trouble.\n\n New to you house? Consider getting one year of \"House Warranty\". If you buy it, it generally means that if anything breaks in your house when you are covered, you can call in a pro to fix it for a fixed price, like $50 or something.\n\nGet a Ring or Blink video doorbell.\n\nInstall motion sensor patio lights.\n\nGet a few flashlights.\n\nAccording to Joe Biden, get a double barrelled shotgun and if bad people show up, get your wife to fire both barrels into the air from the porch.",
