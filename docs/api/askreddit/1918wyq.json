I remember she was relaying a story about the night before. There was a moment that my ears heard utter silence, I had to shake my head in disbelief to come to‚Ä¶ something had dawned on me‚Ä¶ \n\nI asked her, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt stay up to finish?‚Äù \n\nShe looked at me incredulously‚Ä¶ like I was from a different planet and exclaimed, ‚ÄúOh! No! 10PM is time to get ready for bed and asleep by 1030. That‚Äôs why it was crazy I took my dog out at 1022!‚Äù\n\nTo her the routine of going to bed, including the time, received the utmost primacy, seemed almost sacred‚Ä¶ or like it was taboo to fuck with. \n\n\nI had another friend, who was a raver and sorta the absolute opposite of my coworker‚Ä¶ \n\nShe would look deadass in peoples‚Äô eyes to say ‚Äúdo not fuck with my sleep,‚Äù which was a tip off she was about to take a nap. She‚Äôd sleep anywhere. But she always made sure to sleep. \n\nShe would get to a point and announce, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hating all of you and can barely stand myself because I need sleep. Bye.‚Äù\n\nI remember once some friends were giving raver friend a hard time for lagging. She held her ground ‚ÄúI am selfish with sleep. I don‚Äôt want to live without it.‚Äù \n\nTheir attitudes were so‚Ä¶ practical about it‚Ä¶ without any extra stress around it‚Ä¶ \n\nI‚Äôm happy to say I now have a sleep routine that works for me‚Ä¶ I had to stop fighting (with) sleep. It took me a full on mental overhaul to just relax and not stress about the process of getting ready for sleep, sleeping, and waking up‚Ä¶. Etc. \n\nI finally accepted that if I go to bed at 9 or 10, I will wake up 1-3am‚Ä¶ and instead of hate that time stressing that I‚Äôm not asleep, I‚Äôll read, stretch, journal, etc. then I‚Äôll do my go to sleep routine again. Then I wake up between 530-630‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not tired, and feel like I got a full night‚Äôs sleep/relaxation. \n\n\n\nI hope you find your peace with sleep ü§û",

Also falling asleep at the same time everyday no matter what. \n\nJust wanted to share that quantity doesn‚Äôt mean quality for sleep. I know some people who sleep 5-6 hours are quite energetic rest fo the day. I personally only need 6-7 hours max. So I would suggest getting deep sleep rather than amount of sleep. \n\nYou should also check with your doctor if you gave sleep apnea.",

Hold it in for a five Mississippi count and then exhale through your mouth for a seven Mississippi. This does two things: concentrating on counting takes your mind off whatever you may be anxious about and the fact you are exhaling two seconds longer than you are inhaling deprives yourself of air and will make you sleepy.
