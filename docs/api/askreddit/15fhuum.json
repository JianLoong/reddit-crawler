Because I worked as an instore model, I wasn't allowed to leave the front, but I would page another store worker to come help the client. At that point, my associate would come ask me what was going on, I would explain the client needed a size 10 or whatever, and then my associate would go to the back room and lug out a huge ladder to reach the ceiling shelf for the size 10 jeans. Needless to say this was humiliating to girls, and so most girls would try on the pants and if they didn't fit they wouldn't ask for another pair. I think Abercrombie did this on purpose so no one over a size 6 could wear their pants without enduring embarrassment in the store.",

   "message": "Charity and advertisement. \n\nThe existence of a charity is a sign that society is sick: It does not want to take care of its own.\n\nThey also sell tax breaks since otherwise people wouldn't donate to them. Unless it was part of some marketing campaign. See: Mr. Beast. \n\nMr. Beast is basically a spin doctor for hire: By showing you things like \"see look at is giving turkeys to poor people\" and \"See we are cleaning up the beach\", it's designed to distract you from the problem: That these poor people have jobs that aren't compensating them enough to buy what they need. \n\nThat way you will think \"Oh man I should buy a Hormel brand Turkey to give them more money!\" instead of thinking \"What's Hormel trying to cover up?\" or \"Wait why are these disabled people and seniors working and still not having enough to pay for basics...?\" \n\nIf your car is leaking oil, you don't just keep filling it back up: You find why it's leaking oil and fix it. Philanthrocapitalists make you think \"See something is being done\" to keep you pacified. \n\nRemember that episode of undercover boss where a woman worked full time at a sporting goods company, and the CEO decided to recognise her? He should have asked his board members \"Why do we have fulltime employees working for this company who are living in homeless shelters? This year we have hundreds in millions in revenue. Are some of these unpaid wages?\" .\n\nBut that's not what it's about: It's about showing how these people aren't out of touch ghouls. Undercover Boss should really be about how much they are making, how much wage theft they commit every year, and how much they could have still if they paid their fair share in taxes.",

I've managed to reach a point in my career where I can pretty much write my own ticket when I look for work. I was once offered a crazy amount of money to do the payroll for a law firm. They even offered to pay me commute time as well. I was all set to accept the position until I learned that the firm specialized in debt collection. \n\nEven though I wouldn't be dealing with anyone outside the firm (so no calling debtors and collecting money) I just couldn't bring myself to work in that industry. Even my wife thought it was a bad idea, what with the bad karma and all. In the end I declined the offer which ended up working out because I sort of found the opposite end of that spectrum and started doing the payroll for a non-profit museum.",
