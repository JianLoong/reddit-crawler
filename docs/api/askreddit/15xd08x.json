Obviously, it would be irrational to trade 80 years of earthly pleasure for an eternity of torment, but what if the devil said something like....\n\n'Look, quesoandcats, here's how the afterlife works; hell is just the eternal absence of the presence of god. That's basically the same as being here on earth, right? It's not like god is knocking your door down with gifts and attention every day, is it? And imagine you could have everything you wanted while you're here on earth - that'd be pretty sweet, right?\n\nSo, we in hell have a pretty good old time. It's like being here on earth except you know the guy who runs the place. Playing cards, drinking beers, watching netflix. And, I have a VIP room for all the clever people who take an advance pass by selling me their soul while in the mortal realm. You get all the premium channels on your in-room TV and extra M\u0026amp;Ms - sweet huh?\n\nHeaven? Yeah, the upside is you're in His Eternal Presence, sure. But, let me tell you as someone that spent a few millennia up there and ended up getting my own place, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Choirs of angels get grating after a while, and it's all so BRIGHT and WHITE. Not good for a hangover.\n\nI think you'd prefer it downstairs, anyway. So, whaddaya say? Going sign here?'",
