But they had bought me breakfast and mimosas (left at my door with a note by housekeeping) and when they caught me on my way out they apologized for their \"routine\" and even asked me if I wanted to come hang out. \nI had things to do for the day or I would have but seriously.. from all I heard that wasn't at all what I expected.",

How he was a serial philanderer, cheating on his wife early on in their marriage, sexually harassing and abusing numerous actresses he worked with, secretly fathered a child (a daughter) in the 1950s with a fashion model and never acknowledged her existence or helped his biological daughter out, even when she went homeless decades later. Passed away, leaving all his sons and/or grandkids nothing in his will.\n\nPretty shocked to learn what a jerk, a monster, he was in real life.",
