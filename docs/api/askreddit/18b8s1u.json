There's plenty to any animal that isn't the \"alive\" bit, or when isolated can't be said to be alive. Containing some dead stuff doesn't disqualify a creature from being living.\n\nThe universe isn't something we're \"in\" like you're in your house, it's something we're _of_. Every thought you have is the universe thinking. This is to say, you didn't come from some place else, made of some other stuff and made home here in the universe with all the stars and the sheep, the stars made your atoms and the sheep made your meat.\n\nWhat's interesting about this perspective is that it also shows us that the universe is an omniscient entity. If we're the universe, then the universe knows everything we know, and it \"knows\" all of the hidden understandings too, like how our bodies \"know\" how to beat our hearts, even if we can't verbalise it before we've studied medicine. If we feel emotions, the universe is an emotive entity too. It has wants, it has memories, it feels love. \n\nI don't think this particularly says anything about any given religion, so even if this idea sounds neat to you I wouldn't start throwing away your theism or lack thereof.",

Sure there is your brain and everything, but there is still a thing, an I as Descartes called it, that thinks (that’s what he meant by I think therefore I am, if there is something thinking than that thing exists).\n\nHow the hell does that work? Are only humans conscious? Are animals? Are insects? Are bacteria?\n\nAnyway there is a common belief that every single atom in the universe has a form of consciousness of its own, and that ours is merely a sum of those. By that metric we would be closer to cells of an organism than to inhabitants of a body.\n\nThis gets even more interesting when you realize humans are excellent at spreading out energy, which is the universe’s \"goal\". Its like we are cells working towards the greater goal. Each time we burn a piece of coal, each time we turn on a computer, we \"spend\" energy, accelerating the heat death of the universe, which despite being scary, is the point the universe \"wants\" to get too, as it is the most stable, and the universe really likes stability.",
