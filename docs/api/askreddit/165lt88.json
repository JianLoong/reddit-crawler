   "message": "It's a bit unusual, but one of my first childhood crushes was a character from an older movie from the late 90's called \"Babe Pig In The City\". And I still absolutely adore her!\n\nFor context: she's one of the film's main protagonists and comic relief; a plump and mature farm lady who travels to raise money to pay her farm's bills, and takes the titular pig with her. The trip was supposed to be quick and smooth, but because she's a total country bumpkin, it doesn't take long for her to mess up and get stranded in a vicious GTA-like city. She then spends most of her time in slapstick comedy scenes, including some pretty suggestive stuff for a kid's film. \n\nThe parts that got me were one where she rips open her dress and reveals a shot of her large \"rear\" and her white underwear. And the other was in the climax! She races to her pet pig's rescue while forced to wear a weird clown suit as a replacement for her ruined dress because nothing else fits her. Eventually, after a scuffle with a few guys in a huge ballroom party, one of them removes a little tag from the clown suit's trousers. This is when it's revealed that, beneath the clown suit, she was also wearing a pink inflatable rubber suit. Removing the tag activates the inflation gag, and soon enough she starts to blow up. After this \"rubber underwear\" is done inflating, the clown suit is completely torn apart and she looks like a huge pink rubber ball.\n\nI was already feeling \"weird\" because of the ruined dress scene and because of how adorable she looks in the clown costume, but then the scene shows her suit blowing up, her pants ripping open as the rubber grows too large to be contained, and she herself moaning in surprise, discomfort and humiliation as she gets transformed into a huge human balloon against her will. It totally got me!\nEven now I \"blame\" this film for my fascination with plus-sized mature women and the idea of wearing inflatable clothes that get accidentally blown up in public and cause an enormous humiliation to whoever is wearing them.",
