   "message": "Minding my own business on my nightly stroll down the riverbed I see a flashlight shifting under the bridge that leads into the city. I assume it's an inspector, well, inspecting it. It's an old bridge to be fair, and we've had one across town collapse not two weeks ago.  As I close in I notice the man isn't donning a reflective vest. In fact, he's clad in all black with a ski mask on.\n\n\"Strange attire for an engineer.\" I call out to the man, who is clearly shocked by my presence.\n\nHe drops something from his hand, and turns his head to face me. \"I've got a gun, take one step closer and I'll blow your lungs out.\" he says, placing a hand on his waistband. His voice is shaky as he offers the threat.\n\n\"Now why would it come to that?\" I reply, cautiously stepping closer.\n\n\"Good god, get away!\" he shouts back.\n\n\"Well you've just threatened me with a firearm, sir. I'm afraid if I show my back to you you'll start blasting away.\"\n\n\"Swear to me you're not one of them.\" he says. The look in the eye suggests he will not hesitate to fire if I answer incorrectly.\n\n\"Do I look like a cop to you?\" I offer, slowly opening my coat to show him I'm unarmed.\n\nThe man lets out a sigh, throws up his hands in frustration, then beckons me closer.\n\n\"What's this business anyway?\" I ask.\n\n\"Know anything about explosives?\" he responds.\n\n\"A thing or two I picked up from books. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says, picking up the parcel he had dropped earlier. \"I'm looking to blow this one.\"\n\n\"What on earth for?\"\n\n\"Coppers drive this route every morning. Timed charges you see.\" He opens the package. I recognize the contents as plastic explosives.\n\n\"Ah, you must be one of those revolutionaries I've been hearing so much about.\" I say.\n\n\"You aren't a snitch, are you?\" he says, shooting me an accusing glance.\n\n\"I'm sympathetic to your cause, believe that much sir. Just more of watcher than a fighter. You understand.\" I say back.\n\nWe stand there a minute, as an awkward silence falls on the conversation.\n\nI break it.\n\n\"What's this about explosives anyway?\"\n\n\"You see, I can get the damned things to stay in place.\" he says. He shines his light to the various points where he's already placed some. \"I just can't get the timer hooked up properly. Got the time?\"\n\nI pull my sleeve up and check my watch. \"Quarter past three. May I suggest something?\"\n\n\"What's that?\" he asks.\n\n\"You're placing them directly on the support. You'd need ten times the power to blow it from there.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\"\n\nI begin doing my own inspection of the bridge. It's rather small and showing signs of age. Seems to my eye he'd be doing the good folk of this town a favor by getting rid of it regardless.\n\n\"Place them in the middle of the bridge, that's the weak point. You'll be needing a boat or barge to stand on unless you've brought a pair of stilts with you.\" I look down at his cache of explosives. \"By god, couldn't get anymore? That amount wouldn't blow up a bike tire let alone a bridge.\"\n\n\"Times are tough.\" he says dejectedly.\n\nI place my hand on his shoulder in an effort to comfort the poor lad.\n\n\"Tonight's not your night. I suggest you acquire what I've recommended and try again some other time. I'll be passing through here each night around now. If you need anymore help just keep an eye out for me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\" he says. He turns and begins to walk off the way I came.\n\n\"Forgetting something?\" I call out.\n\n\"What?\" he calls back.\n\nI gesture broadly at the mass of explosives he's left strapped to the underside of the bridge.\n\n\"Right, sir. Thank you again sir.\" he says, hurrying back towards me.\n\n\"Good night and godspeed you brave devil.\" I say to him as he scrambles to collect his items.\n\nI continue along the path, satisfied that my engineering degree did not go to complete waste.",

   "message": "\"Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb,\" I noted with surreal calm, watching the old, scraggly man strap a collection of C4 bricks to the underside of the bridge. It crossed over the Hillevi River in Macklemore, Arizona, less than a mile away from my house, along the path of one of my favorite walking trails. \n\nHearing me, he turned and fixed my eyes with his: they shimmered like a fresh graphics card pulled from a Best Buy box, and I suddenly found a deep, tugging desire to leave and forget everything, strong like the compulsion to stop running when you're on a treadmill and start wondering if your legs will buckle and get your knees ground up by the belt because you never wear that damn safety clip. \n\nBut I fought it. See, I'm a writer. I do it for a living, and I love it. And these daily walks are coal in the engine of my train of thought. Without the coal, the train doesn't run, and without the train running, the books don't get written. I don't get paid. My family - my wife, my daughter - they don't eat. And my family eats, baby.\n\n\"Nah, fuck off, go blow up some other bridge,\" I commanded. \n\nHe blinked, surprised, and climbed down from his perch. I backed up. He stared at me harder, and his shimmering eyes reached anime-girl-looking-at-cute-school-gerbil levels of nonsensical shimmer, which was fucking terrifying in real life, I'll tell you what. \n\n\"You...you're not bowing to my commands. You should be bowing to my commands!\" the man shouted. His teeth flashed, his incisors longer than normal.\n\nCrazy guy with sharp teeth, or legit vampire? I didn't care. I whipped out my phone. \"Listen up, one call from me, and the fuzz will be on your ass. You'd better start talking.\"\n\nThe question of crazy or vampire was answered: with a hiss, he turned into a ton of bats, and flew off. I started to call the cops, and that's when the entire bridge went up in a huge ball of flame.\n\nSuffice it to say, the trail was destroyed, and I can't walk very well after the force of the blast threw me into the rocks beside the trail and crushed a few vertebrae in my lower back to powder.\n\nBut that's all right with me, it was all worth it: the train's got enough coal now to last a lifetime.",

   "message": "  \nSo I’d gotten off work about twenty minutes ago. And I’d taken to walking home. I usually just pulled overtime till morning rolled around. But I felt like changing things up. So here I was, at pitch black o’ clock strolling through the much sketchier version of my usual commute.   \nI was about to walk over this bridge, when I noticed something to the side of it. Shit, it’s not a jumper is it? I ran to the side, leaning over the first bridge post. And shining the light of my phone over it.   \n“Hey! Get that damn light out of my eyes!” Someone yelled. Their voice was high-pitched and irritate.  \n“Oh sorry!” I said, moving it to the side. From where I was I could now see them clearly, even without the direct illumination. They seemed to be wearing a button up, and were rather… wait, stop checking them out! Though the odd position of trying to reach the bridge's underside, while leaning over the side, seemed uncomfortable.  \nThey leaned back up, straightening themself before getting back onto the bridge. From there they pulled some rectangular things out of a bag, took a few steps down the bridge, and then leaned back over the side. Doing some crazy contorting to stick those squares to the bridges underside.  \n“What are you still doing there!” They said, looking back at me. It was hard to see in the dark, but I could swear they were now attaching some kind of wire to one of those squares.  \n“Uh, sorry!” I said, beginning to walk back down the bridge. I glanced at their bag as I went. Pausing. Is that a timer? And why is there one of those weird bike pump looking things you see when people use dynamite…. Oh shit! I looked back over the side. Making direct eye contact with the bag’s owner. They were glaring at me through the bridge beams as I gaped at them. “Are those…”  \nDon’t ask! What if they have one of those shooty things too! I closed my mouth. But started gaping again, as I stared at them. They seemed a little awkward as they tried to reach back under the bridge with their muscular arms. Still glaring at me as beads of sweat appeared.  \nThey twisted a bit. Taking a step down from where they had been standing. From there they grabbed the ledge of the bridge with one arm. And lowered themself again. Dangling from a single arm as they swung.  \n“What are you doing?” I said. Watching them swing with that thingamajig in one of their hands.  \nThey rolled their eyes. “Stop being a lurker.” they said, slapping another box onto the bridge. Still, as they did this their hand slipped from the wet concrete.  \nI dove to the side, reaching for them as they dropped into the darkened river. “Hey! Are you alright!” I shouted, leaning over the railing.  \nI could see their bag slip over the edge as it was pulled by some kind of wire, the same kind that was attached to the squares. I could hear it drag across the bridge. And a second or two later there was a splash.  \nI shined my light down at the water, gripping the cold steel with my free hand. “Hey! Hey! Are you alight!?” I repeated. Searching the rippling water for any sign of them. Doesn’t matter what they were up to. This person obviously needed some help right now.  \n30 seconds later I saw a head emerge from the water, It was accompanied by a loud gasp. They seemed to be treading water cause their arms were somehow occupied by that bag. The one with all the wires coming out of it.  \nI didn’t spare it a thought, sprinting down the bridge and turning to the side. From there I slid down the steep incline that led to a thin walking path beneath it. I skidded at the bottom, landing on my knees. I hissed as the pathway chaffed my knees. Throwing myself back to my feet I looked back at the river. Hearing some more loud gasps as the would be TNT-er bobbed in and out of the water.  \n“Toss me the bag!” I shouted, seeing it weigh him down, all those wires looked like a real hazard too.  \n“No!” He shouted, pulling it closer to them. Slipping back under the water as they did so.  \nI facepalmed. Deciding to try again. “Toss me the bag! You can’t swim with it! Come on! You’re in danger!”  \nThey emerged again, throwing large splashes all around. “Fine!” They shouted, tossing it with all their might.  \nWe both stared awkwardly as it landed in the water halfway between us. “Uh…” I said. Watching it disappear. I heard them take a loud breath, and wondered if they were gonna dive for it. “Wait! We can pull it from the wires! It’ll be easier! Just get out of the water!”  \nThey looked like they would’ve sighed if they could breathe right. Instead they started swimming towards me. Making large strokes with their arms, avoiding the spot right in front of me where a ton of wires went down into the water.  \nI shuffled to the side, so I was closer. Finally after a minute or so of swimming they reached the edge. I crouched down, reaching out for them, but with the arm that wasn’t desperately grasping at the edge, they slapped my hand away.  \nThen they used it to grab at the edge, as they struggled to try and get up. They grunted in effort, and went about an inch up. Their arms were shaking terribly, until they started falling back into the water.  \nIgnoring what they said I grabbed under their armpits. Lifting with all my might, as I pulled the both of us back towards the river bank. Finally they emerged, falling backwards onto the river bank. Crushing me under them.  \n“Ouch!” I said, crushed against the grass and someone who was deceptively heavy and absolutely drenched in freezing water. After a minute or so of catching my breath I was getting kind of cold, so I gave the overly muscular guy a light tap. “Uh, can you get up?”  \n“I don’t think I can move…” They said,  \n“Oh.” Well this is awkward.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_   \nA day and a half later  \n“So how are you?” I said, glancing at my coworker.  \n“I’ve been having a real rough day. Did you hear the news? This morning that bridge by Limestone St. got blown up!”  \n“Shit! That was my favorite bridge!” I said, then realization dawned on me… “That-”",

   "message": "\"Nice night, comrade.\" He was stock still in the deep shadows of the bridge. He had turned his flashlight off when we made eye contact.\n\n\"Well, it was.\"\n\n\"Really? Still seems like a nice night to me, quiet. I see no reason for things to change, do you, comrade?\" He shifted uneasily. Calling him comrade was having the intended effect.\n\n\"*Thou art not my comrade.\"* He spoke in old Castilian with a heavy accent.\n\n\"Maybe not, but you do have one here don't you. Probably more than one, there are men in these hills. We saw them at last month's train. Tell me comrade, were you responsible for that explosion too?\" He started to back slowly to the other side of the bridge. I slung my rifle from my shoulder to my arms. He stopped moving, though his hands remained at his sides. \"That was a fine explosion.\"\n\n\"No, the train was not my doing.\"\n\n\"Good, I thought we had captured the one responsible. Now, where are the men, where is your support? No man could string this bridge alone in one night by himself.\"\n\n\"They are coming, they may have seen you and ran, these men are foxes.\" He took slow steps forward until his legs were in the dim moonlight, face still just a silhouette. \"Who are you, *comrade.* You are no mere sentry.\"\n\n\"*Thou are a keen one.\"* They were speaking in normal tones and still there were no signs of anyone in the trees. \"I am one who thinks like your general does. Who is he? Kuznetsov?\"\n\n\"Golz.\"\n\n\"I do not know him. He is a good comrade. Surely, he drinks when you discuss bridges.\" I brought a cigarette to my lips but did not light it. \"You drink too, no? Want one?\" The man scoffed and shifted his weight before reaching his hand into the light. I threw him a cigarette.\n\n\"I do not drink while we discuss bridges.\"\n\n\"I see, then then the men are not coming. They are in the pines, *carrera*.\"\n\n\"You might be right, they are foxes, it takes wolves to blow a bridge.\" He pulled out a lighter and lit his joint, lighting his face briefly. He was young. \"And I imagine it takes a wolf to patrol a bridge suspected of exploding.\"\n\n\"It does.\"\n\n\"This bridge must blow tomorrow.\"\n\n\"My army must cross this bridge tomorrow. My reinforcements too.\" The man took a long drag from his cigarette before tossing me his lighter. I lit my cigarette.\n\n\"Then I suggest your army, and your reinforcements, cross this bridge before I am given the order.\"\n\n\"*When are thou to get the order.*\"\n\n\"After your army crosses the bridge, before the reinforcements.\"\n\n\"It is a shame to not be a fox. We could have worked together, comrade.\"\n\n\"We wouldn't be here if we were foxes.\"\n\n\"True, true, comrade.\"\n\nWe continued to smoke in the dark.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n(Yes, this is heavily inspired by \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" I am reading it right now and this prompt was just too coincidental)",
