   "message": "I used to have a job working front desk 3rd shift concierge at a swanky apartment tower.  Very exclusive.  NFL players, NBA players, MLB players, high end all around.  The top floor is a penthouse owned by the owner of a modeling firm.  \n\nPaid. Like. Shit.\n\nOne night two girls come in, want to purchase a few things from the residents dispensary (like a in house 7-11), I just get a room number and it gets tacked onto the monthly rent.\n\nWhile one is getting a few things, the other decides to tell me her life story and is asking me for advice on all these life-changing things she's thinking about doing.  When the other was done shopping, she came over to the counter and the two of them just chatted with me for a couple hours, asking for my advice on everything - and I mean everything.  I felt like a therapist for them.  After a while, they wanted me to come upstairs and party with them and the friend they were visiting.  I assumed they were at least a little drunk, but they had been there for a while, and they weren't getting any more sober.\n\nAnd then the person who they were visiting (a lawyer who lived in the building) came down and was like \"where the hell have you two been?\" and ushered them upstairs.\n\nNext day at the start of my shift, he was waiting for me.  He apologized profusely and gave me a $200 tip and asked me to not mention the two girls to anyone.\n\nApparently they were a pair of escorts and were high as a fucking kite on Extacy.",

I bought a ¬£500 tv from this shop 4 weeks ago ! I‚Äôm not stupid I can see the tv on the wall !‚Äù\n\nMe ‚Äú So that single tv is the one we use to monitor cctv and let customers know they‚Äôre on camera , we have a lot of issues with theft and stock loss , again I think you want to be talking to Sony staff the shop is like 50 meters down the road , and your receipt says Sony , this is not Sony , we don‚Äôt sell Sony items here , we sell guitars and pianos .‚Äù\n\nLady : ‚Äú where is your manager , I was in this shop 4 weeks ago and one of you sold me a TV that hasn‚Äôt showed up , there were TV‚Äôs on the wall like that and speakers like those you have over there . You‚Äôre a liar and you‚Äôre calling me a liar or stupid , either way I want my refund NOW ‚Äú\n\nMe : ‚Äú Well I am the manager , I have worked here for 4 years and can guarantee you we have never sold a TV to yourself or anybody else . You‚Äôre being rude and you need to leave now .‚Äù \n\nBest part is she threw the receipt at me and a couple racist slurs , stormed out . \nShe comes back in 5 minutes later and starts shouting whilst I‚Äôm helping an actual customer \n‚Äú WHERE DID YOU PUT MY RECEIPT ?! YOU STOLE IT DIDN‚ÄôT YOU ‚Äú \n\nI pulled her receipt out the bin as it was just resting on top , gave it back to her and gave her a sickly sweet smile ‚Äú so did you find the correct shop on the end or are you just going up and down the road berating random shop workers ?‚Äù \n\nShe got a bit dumbfounded and just stood with her mouth moving but no sound coming out so I held the door open , pointed at the giant Sony sign visible from the doorway ‚Äú that is the Sony shop by the way, good luck!‚Äù",
