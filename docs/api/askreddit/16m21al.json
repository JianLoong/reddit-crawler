She always seemed interested in our friend group and our hobby of playing card games at the cafe after school/work. \n\nWe offered her to join us on a day off one day, to which she agreed! She and I eventually got interested in each other and started going back to her place. I thought we were on the path of a relationship at the time. \n\nI found out a few weeks later when her boyfriend showed up at the cafe and confronted her and me together. I felt awful for the whole thing and apologized to the guy, but he was hella pissed. She tried REALLY hard to blame me for the affair which he kinda bought. \n\nAnyways, like 5 years later I was working as a server at a diner when the (now ex) boyfriend came in as a customer with his wife and newborn baby! He immediately recognized me. Before he and his wife left after eating he came up to me and apologized for what happened back then and said it wasnâ€™t my fault for what happened and he learned the truth over time. He and I shook hands, we wished each other the best and Iâ€™ve never seen him again since then.",

Anyway, he wanted me back int he house regardless of my use because he was a worried dad ect, and I moved back in, still using.

My phone vibrated and I looked down to see a text from my dad, asking if I could find and and if I could find ðŸ’‰ (which I was using at the time too). I was shocked because it was unexpected but quickly got excited and immediately began messaging around. My luck that day was very minimal and I watch him use one of my very used (2x at least) rigs to slam. I'm surprised watching that didn't make me quit. We both used together for a while, and my stepmom eventually joined in. I ended up having to skip town and my dad slowly lost his job he had for years, then the truck, then the rental, so on. He is doing alright now, but I got to watch that landslide happen because I said yes.\n\nWhat I regret is ever telling him I could find it, and even feeling excited because my drug fueled mind told me that means id get some too. He never held a grudge against me. Our relationship isn't harmed, and I've expressed my guilt for bringing it back into his life. All he tells me is \"it's not your fault kiddo\"but I will die with that guilt. Among many more choices that were fueled by my use of drugs.",

Or weekly. We both started messaging him and we came up with this story that she lived a block away from where he did. Created this whole story that this catfish account was living with her parents, but were never home. Her dad was a lawyer who traveled everywhere and the mom was some artist. she had a younger brother and always took care of him. She was homeschooled yada yada. Anyways, it got to the point where i had been talking with my ex for about a solid MONTH. (this was back when i was in hs. had too much time on my hands.) and he confessed that he was starting to like me. Said that we should meet up one day. so i agreed to it. we made a plan to meet up at some park nearby. but i never showed up. He messaged me the next day asking why did i ditch him? I didn't say anything for a few days then got back to him. I made up something like my mom came home and asked me where i was going, she grounded me. We messaged less and less, until one day I decided to just send him a picture of me saying that i had been catfishing him etc. He sent me a 5 minute voice message talking about how embarrassed but angry he was. He went off on me basically. told me to leave him alone. I deleted the catfish account.\n\nA year or so later, he randomly reached out to me out of nowhere. He said that despite what i did to him, he had forgiven me for what happened. I did tell him i was sorry and that it was shitty what I did. i showed my best friend the conversation and she laughed at him. Said that he is so sensitive, that he cannot take a joke. Mind you they used to be good friends. she didn't really care. He and I talked for a bit but then we just stopped talking again. I hope he's doing ok wherever he is. It was such a stupid thing to do- i can't imagine doing this to somebody again.\n\nTLDR: Me and my best friend catfished my ex bf.

I told him it was lemonade because he had this annoying habit of asking for everything you were eating whenever her came over. Be it a bite or a sip it really ticked me off. Anyway once he drank it he spat it out realizing what it was. I bribed him $5 not to tell he had a sore stomach for two days and missed school. Anyway this happened as kids and forgave me back then. He was always a deviant hyperactive menace. Later turned out he was just super intelligent and under stimulated with controlling parents. He went to uni became quite successful he hasn't been home in 4 years since graduating uni. I'm happy for him.",
