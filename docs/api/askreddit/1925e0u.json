My cousin hasd boxes of artifacts from their relationship. They went to family weddings together, socialized publicly, etc. \n\n-apparently in these days, parents had to give permission for a girl to marry a foreigner. (Don‚Äôt know if this was a legal thing, or a societal pressure thing.). But the bottom line was that her parents wouldn‚Äôt give permission. He still sent money and photos and stuff, and so they decided to tell him the baby had died in hopes that he would stop trying. It worked. \n\n-Grandpa went on and got married and had 3 kids, then split and got married again, this time to my grandma. But my whole life, he got SO emotional when talking about NL. More so than Italy or Germany, where he was also stationed. I always throught that this was because he was part of the liberation of holland, so he felt more connected to the people there. (I was kind of right!)\n\n-my Dutch cousin and his family are AMAZING. They invited my partner and I to NL last year, and the best way I can phrase is is ‚Äúwe met as strangers, and we left as family‚Äù. We still talk all the time. His 8 year old daughter loves to make fun of my Canadian accent when I try to speak Dutch, and I love that. \n\n-\n2nd edit: just a fun story. When I visited NL, I was lucky enough to go to my cousin‚Äôs anniversary party and meet a couple hundred wonderful locals. They kept excitedly calling us the ‚ÄúKennedys‚Äù, and my partner and I were sooo confused, but flattered. (We thought maybe it was slang for North Americans? We had no idea!)\nFast forward a couple of days, and we went to the cemetery for Canadian soldiers and saw the sign‚Ä¶.. Canadese is Dutch for Canadians. ü§£\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrandpa fathered a baby in the Netherlands at the end of WW2. Her parents didn‚Äôt want her coming back to Canada with him, so they told him the baby died of pneumonia around age 3. \n\nI didn‚Äôt find out until grandpa had been dead for about 15 years. Found grandpa‚Äôs name on another family tree and sent a ‚Äúhi! And you are?‚Äù message. Immediately got back ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been looking for you all for years‚Äù message. \n\nFast forward a few years, and my dutch cousin has some to visit us in Canada, and I have been to the Netherlands to meet a huge family I never knew about.

My grandmother  was definitely pregnant when she got married. I reached out to some biological relatives via the sites and once I mentioned who my potential bio grandfather is I get blocked. It's happened more than once and I can't seem to get past this road block of trying to find anything more. Doesn't seem like a big deal, I just wanna know what the big mystery is. My dad was in and out of jail, had issues with drug abuse and was also treated as the \"worthless\" kid from a young age. I wonder if that is also because of who his bio dad is? Families are weird.",

   "message": "This just happened recently, and it was actually discovered years after the test was taken. My boyfriend had a DNA test taken years ago to find out his family history. Did it, and then moved on, thinking nothing else of it.  \n\nA few months ago, someone had messaged him on the DNA website, but he wasn‚Äôt aware of it until a week or so later when he was reading his email and saw they had tried messaging him again. They were asking my boyfriend if he has a brother, then described his brother and asked if they were at so-and-so during a certain month many years ago, which he was and the description lined up.  \n\nMy brother thought it was weird and kind of fishy at first. He checked their profile, they have a 27% match with him. They ended up talking a bit more. Turns out it was the mother of the girl who took the DNA test. She was trying to find her ten-year-old daughter‚Äôs father, my boyfriend‚Äôs brother. My boyfriend was finally able to show me the messages and asked me what he thinks he should do with the information, how he should tell his brother about this.  \n\nI wanted to do some investigating first and ended up looking up the mom‚Äôs name on Facebook and found a match; something I‚Äôm not really proud of, but I had to make sure this *somehow* wasn‚Äôt some kind of joke before we told his brother about it. The daughter in the pictures looks *exactly* like my boyfriend‚Äôs brother. So much so that you just know, without a doubt, that‚Äôs his brother‚Äôs daughter.  \n\nAnyway. Long story short. The day we wanted to tell his brother, we asked him what he wanted to eat for dinner. He went and showered before we went to go pick up the food. While we were out, he decided he also wanted a shake from his favorite spot. Which was perfect because we were trying to make sure he was in as good of a mood as possible.  \n\nWe got home, ate. He said he wanted to watch an episode of a show he‚Äôs been watching, while we ate our shakes. So we got the show ready to start. Sat him down and told him we have some big news before we start the show. We gently gave him the news, and told him we‚Äôre supportive of whatever he decides to do with this information. We won‚Äôt be judgmental no matter what he chooses to do. We let him go through his feelings but stayed with him and asked if he needed anything, like some water or a shot of alcohol lol.  \n\nHe ended up meeting his daughter a couple of days later. He‚Äôs already so in love with her. He‚Äôs just sad he‚Äôs missed so many years of her life. He really needed something like this in his life. She‚Äôs a sweetheart. I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre already getting along well and it‚Äôs good to see how happy she‚Äôs making him. *He did end up doing a paternity test to be one hundred percent sure she‚Äôs his daughter.*",

When I was going through his stuff about 4 years ago , I found a photo of him taken in 1945. He would have been 17 at the time. I couldn't believe my eyes. He and my friend had looked almost identical at that age. It was uncanny. When I showed my friend the photo, he suggested we get a DNA test. He had apparently suspected for years, but his parents refused to tell him anything. We found out that in 1967, my grandfather had an affair with a woman who lived less than 10 miles away from him and had a daughter with her. The woman died during childbirth, and since he didn't want to admit to the affair, he arranged to have his daughter adopted by a close friend who had been unable to have kids with his wife. She ended up becoming best friends with his youngest legitimate daughter, who was the same age. He told them both the truth when they turned 18. Her son and I are the same age and have known each other pretty much since birth, but I never would have thought that were related. \n\n\nTL;DR: My grandfather had an affair, and DNA proved that my best friend is really my cousin",
