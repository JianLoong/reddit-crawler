I was 9 years old, and I had just had the opportunity to start playing Final Fantasy 12 back on the PS2. I loved it, beat it, all is well. But there’s one monster/boss in the game that freaked me out, and that was the Demon Wall. Something about it’s face and it’s legs. Now here’s where this ties into the topic. Y’all remember Lord of the Rings? I sure do. Favorite movie series of all time, I know every word, and every single trivia fact. But. That fucking. Balrog. He has a very similar face to the Demon Wall, and I used to have a recurring nightmare of a giant, and I mean giant, Balrog/Demon Wall hybrid stepping on me and killing me instantly, and after that, I always had to skip that scene in LotR. I have other stories that go along with this but this one was the first that came up.",
