 "selftext": "We had target farming for uniques in hell tide for about 3 hours. It was designed, patched in and we had it. Then someone at Blizzard didn't account for the uber uniques dropping and some people actually got some. They emergency patched and we no longer have target farming for uniques in helltide and the Mystery Chests cost 75 more.\n\nMost of us could care less these uber uniques exists at all considering the drop rate. The game at this point would have been better off without them since we would still have target farming.\n\nThat aside they have had quite some time to bring back our target farming and... It isn't even on the radar anymore due to the state of the game and the last patch.\n\nBring back target farming.\n\n/rant",
