   "message": "This one wasn't a dating/relationship one. It was a customer at the body shop I worked at. \n\nHe called up to the shop every day his car was in there and after the first few days I told him that we would call him and update him as things got completed so he didn't have to call every day and he said \"I just like to call to hear your voice\". I didn't really know what to say other than \"well we will call you when there are any updates on your car, have a good day\" and then I told the mechanic about it and how i wasnt going to talk to that guy anymore because it felt inappropriate and weird. So the next day the mechanic called the customer first thing in the morning to try and give him the update and he refused to talk to the mechanic. Said he only wanted to talk to me. The mechanic (sweet but tough older man who didn't take shit from anyone) told him to leave me alone and that he wouldn't be talking to me anymore and hung up on him. Then the dude came up to the shop to look for me. Luckily we saw him before he came inside the shop so the mechanic sent me out back and said I wasn't there. The guy called again later that day looking for me and showed up again the next day. Every day until his car was fixed he would either call or come to the shop. Luckily the mechanic made sure to get the guys car fixed and out of the shop as quick as he could. And the mechanic and painter walked me to my car every day for months just to make sure the guy didn't come back around. They were just as freaked out by him as I was. I don't know how to explain it but he felt dark and I felt so uneasy around the guy and the moment he said he just called to talk to me made me super uncomfortable.",
