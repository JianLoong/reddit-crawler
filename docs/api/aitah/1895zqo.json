 "selftext": "I 30(F) have just landed an amazing job. My friend 28(F) helped me get this job because she rejected it when it was offered to her and she suggested my name in her place. \n\nWe were good friends and also worked in the same field but in different companies.\n\nI recently got a promotion and a trip offer. When she found out, she was pissed. She called me, angry and crying, saying that I got this promotion only because of her recommendation. And that I wouldn't be here without her. She said she was with me during my worst time and she wanted to know why I didn't think of giving her some share from my profit.\n\nIn my defense, I did try to call and message her multiple times, but she is busy with her work trips and hardly picks up my call. She also has a successful work life, only that my position is slightly higher than hers. My boss was happy with my work and so he offered me a promotion.\n\nI tried to tell her this and even called multiple times, but she won't talk to me. \n\nSo AITAH and how can I help her understand that I can't give her anything from my company as we don't work in the same organization?",
