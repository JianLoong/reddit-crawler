Like no matter how many attacks they receive, they will keep going until they win. \n\nBut getting punched in the face will make you lose all thought and vision.  It takes like a good 5-10 seconds before you can really process what happened.  And in the middle of a fight, you don't really have that much time.  Your brain will kind of force a thought of \"Ok, just stop\".\n\nIt doesn't really hurt in the moment, but its a very disoriented feeling that makes it difficult to do anything.  \n\nSo if you are really gonna get into a fight, and want to win, try to land that first punch, and protect your own head as much as possible.  They don't need to knock you out to win, they just need one solid punch to the jaw to make you forget what you were doing in the first place.",
