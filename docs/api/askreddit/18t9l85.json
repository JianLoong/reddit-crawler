   "message": "Taking accountability and apologize. My parents never apologize to us for anything. They taught us to apologize for small things like bumping someone, spill a drink, etc., basic manner stuff. But when they hurt our feelings they never apologize cause they considered it \"tough love\", even after we said their words hurt. So naturally, my sister and I had a really hard time apologizing when we said or did something wrong to our friends. We're much better now and has long realized our parents are typical toxic boomer parent. \n\nAlso, a civil conflict resolve. It genuinely never occured to me that you can resolve conflicts without yelling because my mom ALWAYS yells when there's disagreement. She kept saying it's our fault to make her so angry that she yells at us. So I always thought it's completely okay to yell at people when you're riled up or angry, as long as they're not your parents. Same as before, I'm much better at controlling my temper with other people now. Can't say the same when I argue with my mom. She always shouts and yells at me so I did the same. But of course I'm the problem because daughters/sons are supposed to stay quiet and nod when their parents yell at them, even when the parents are in the wrong (legit what my mom said lol).",
