It had a door facing the rest of the post, so I figured nobody would find me, and anyone outside the outpost would be none the wiser. Well I heard some footsteps coming up, and tried to tuck my junk away, and in my haste I tripped and fell on a wooden bench that we were using as a step stool, and tore up my shin. I still have a gigantic scar there. And nobody ever came up. Guy just went halfway up the stairs to get better cell reception. \n\nSo I went to war and did all this stuff and my only scar is from trying to interrupt a spank session.",
