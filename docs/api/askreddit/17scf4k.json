She was brilliant! \n\nEventually she outgrew our company and went to another where she was lauded for saving them a boatload of money by recognizing a simpler and cheaper way to do something.\n\nWhen she first joined our company she was a new immigrant who struggled with English and was being abused by her husband. She left him, struggled for a few years, then her smarts brought her recognition and a high salary. She remarried one of our co-workers, the nicest guy on the planet, and I absolutely could not be happier for her.",

Just think of your voltage as the amount of water you have in a tank or how much pressure is in the tank. Then you have a pipe coming out the bottom.  That amount of water flow is the current. The bigger the pipe, the more flow which mean there's less resistance (ohms).  The electrical version of pipe is wire size.  You need to have a path for the water to flow or else you get no flow (no current) and only pressure (voltage).\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a 14 or 15 year old kid, this was an ah ha moment for me.  Then I started imagining myself peeing electron flow everytime I went to the urinal.",
