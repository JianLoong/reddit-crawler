 "title": "*UPDATE* WIBTAH IF I DIVORCE MY HUSBAND OVER FINACIALL ISSUES",
 "selftext": "Hello everyone, I know I have been asked to give an update and I am sorry it took a while and I don't know if i am even doing this right, but things have been wild. so on to the update we are getting divorced.  We did talk and he had tried to change his mind and say he was sorry that he will do better but at this time the damage was done. We did talk about everything, and he does feel remorseful. He did move out and my two kids and I have the house and he did go to be with his mom until he can put money away for him and his daughter to get their own place. He asked that we stay friends and I'm okay with that because my children still want to call him, and I don't mind that. Right now, things are extremely hard for them, but we are working through it and that's the best thing we can do. I talked to the kids to see if we can do family counseling and they both said yes and so I think with some help we will be fine. Financially I am fine. and now my primary job told me I can bring the kids to work any time I need to have them with me if I don't have childcare, so I get to spend more time with them too! I know they are worried about mom but my main concern is their mental health so that is my primary focus I want them to be okay. Thank you all for opening my eyes and helping me express how I have been feeling and I just truly appreciate you! ",

We are exactly the same age I'm so happy to read that someone else made the opposite choices I did and saved themselves. \n\nI read the original post and it happened after I got married too. They worked and from the looks of it had an amazing work ethic. Moved in together and everything just halted and they refused to work, put everything on me and we ended up homeless TWICE. \n\nThe worst of it was our lights getting shut off, figuring out we owed over $1700 on the electric bill my ex fought to have put in her name and she switched to paperless without confirming her email so she \"never got the bills\" therefore never paid them. \nI sat in the dark in the middle of winter for almost 2 WEEKS, had no access to heat or hot water, and had to drain EVERY penny of mine I could find, and my friend (now my current bf) gave me the rest which was like $600. \nMy ex said she had nothing and somehow didn't get paid and just packed up and went to her Mom's house. I have no family anymore for various reasons (including marrying them) so I couldn't do the same even though I'm the one that's always worked from home (meaning I couldn't work for almost 2 weeks). Luckily got the money back when my job had me apply for an emergency charity fund, so I could still pay rent and other bills and not get evicted a third time. I \"made too much money\" for any state assistance programs. \n\nTurns out she had $500 saved up she just didn't want to spend because she was seeing someone else in another state and was saving up for a plane ticket to go visit and didn't want to have to start over and delay her trip. üôÉ\n\nFinancial abuse is serious, OP. It's been almost 2 years and I'm still around 6K in debt, and my credit score is still trash after paying over 2K of it. Be proud you didn't let yourself or your kids get to these points. This is a super important decision you made for your life and you should hug yourself every time you begin to doubt you're doing the right thing. \n\nAmazing job, OP!",
