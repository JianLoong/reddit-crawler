   "message": "Alzheimer's.\n\n  \nThey say it isn't hereditary, but it definitely runs in my family. There's a lot of things I'm scared of but I can easily suck it up or shrug off, but Alzheimer's? Fuck that. Forgetting who you are? Forgetting who the people you love are? Amnesia is one thing, you can understand that you lost your memories and you get to experience everything again. But with Alzheimer's you can't even comprehend that- you're just constantly scared and delirious of where you are or even who you are. If I start to show signs of Alzheimer's and there's no cure or treatment yet, I'm offing myself",
