It felt like I got stabbed in the ears from the inside. It affected my hearing a bit for like a week before it went back to normal.\n\nWould love for anyone to come up with another solution because I’ll be having another trip soon.\n\nEdit: Yes, forgot to mention but I also have tried holding my nose and blow it, didn’t work. Also, appreciate every advice you guys gave me! I might visit a doctor for it.\n\nEdit 2: I’ll try nasal spray and get some earplanes. Thank you again!",

Add to this police training where I was out in 100+ heat for 10 hours in a black uniform with my ballistic vest and full tactical gear. We stopped for water breaks and I thought I had enough. How wrong I was. Cut to that evening, I had eaten supper, drank a ton of water, and crawled into bed. I was awakened about 90 minutes later with a severe pain in my upper right calf. I was having the worst Charlie Horse I had ever had. Immediately, I jumped out of bed and tried to stretch out the cramp. As I did, my opposing muscles in my right leg cramped just as hard as the first cramp.  Within seconds, my other leg cramped, then my back, abs, and arms followed in quick succession. In less than a minute after waking up, my entire body was cramping so bad that my right leg was being pulled so tight my heel nearly touched the back of my head. I could feel by bones stressing under the extreme tension. I was screaming in agony, which woke family. They grabbed electrolyte tabs and got them under my tongue. They also were able to feed me a little water. However, my ordeal was far from over. After my family found me, another 45 minutes elapsed until the cramps all subsided. I was transported to the local ER. The result? I had torn 3 muscles, pulled dozens more, recieved damage to a handful of tendons and ligaments, and the doctors found out that I had mono bad enough that I should have been dead 30-60 days prior. The attending said he had worked in the ER for 20+ yrs and had never seen a spleen or liver so inflamed. He cautioned me that a slight bump could rupture one or both.
