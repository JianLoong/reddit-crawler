   "message": "Reddit has evolved significantly over the past decade, and several things that were once considered normal or common on the platform have changed. Here are a few notable differences:\n\n1. **Less Commercialization:** Reddit used to be a relatively ad-free space. While ads exist today, they were far less prevalent a decade ago. Additionally, sponsored content and promoted posts were not as common.\n\n2. **Simpler Design:** Reddit's interface and design have undergone multiple changes. A decade ago, the platform had a simpler, more text-based design compared to the modern card-style layout with images and videos.\n\n3. **Community Size:** Many subreddits (individual communities on Reddit) have grown significantly in size over the years. Smaller communities used to be more common, whereas today, some subreddits have millions of members.\n\n4. **Memes and Inside Jokes:** The memes and inside jokes on Reddit have evolved over the years. What was popular or funny a decade ago might not have the same relevance today due to changing internet culture.\n\n5. **Different Subreddit Culture:** The culture within specific subreddits can change over time. Some subreddits that were once known for certain types of content or discussions might have shifted their focus or rules.\n\n6. **Self-Promotion:** Rules regarding self-promotion have become stricter in many subreddits. Ten years ago, it might have been easier to promote personal content or products without encountering as many restrictions.\n\n7. **Political Landscape:** The political climate and discussions on Reddit have evolved, reflecting changes in global politics. Certain subreddits and political ideologies that were prevalent a decade ago may not hold the same prominence today.\n\n8. **Reddit Gold:** Reddit Gold was once a popular way to support the platform and reward quality content. It has since been replaced by Reddit Premium and Coins as part of the site's monetization strategy.\n\n9. **Novelty Accounts:** A decade ago, novelty accounts (users who posted in character or with a specific theme) were more common and celebrated. While they still exist, they may not be as prevalent or well-received today.\n\n10. **Reddit's Role in News:** Reddit's role in news and information dissemination has grown significantly over the years, and the platform now has more stringent rules and guidelines related to news and information credibility.\n\nIn summary, Reddit has transformed in numerous ways over the past decade, reflecting changes in internet culture, technology, and the platform's own policies and priorities. What was once considered normal or common on Reddit has evolved to adapt to these changes.",

I only started almost 9 years ago, but it was way worse. \n\nBack then Reddit engaged in a sort of unintentional experiment where they identified the worst offenders. I believe they came up with about 15,000 of the worst offenders for that content and they culled them. And they saw that sort of content among remaining users nosedive 80%+. It is interesting for an academic standpoint because it indicates that these very toxic individuals sort of infect others. When you remove them...things get better. \n\nIt was quite a time. Subs being closed. Trolls invading other subs in revenge. You still see some of the lingering sentiment in people complaining about Reddit no longer having \"free speech\" or \"diverse opinions\".
