Yes you won't get the answer to everything but that's part of the point, how would God explain to a human the theory of everything? It wouldn't happen.

Like Breaking Bad or The Big Bang Theory - The show runners knew where to wrap the original show up before they jumped the shark but the show was popular enough that they kept making related shows where, if they did end up jumping he shark, it wouldn't ruin the solid arc and ending of the original show.",
