Granted, not everyone struggles with postpartum so I hope that you never have to face this particular challenge, but if you do, PLEASE go and get help right away! I had no idea what I was going through and I lost a year of real bonding with my baby as a result.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more “physical” answer, I would say the hemorrhoids.

Turns out, I've yet to arrive in a place in life where I'd feel ready (emotionally and financially) to raise a child. Had I kept focusing on having kids, I might have some by now and I'm very confident I would be a terrible mother.",
