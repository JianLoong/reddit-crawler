Senior year rolls around and day 1 my head coach names me a captain. I was so extremely proud and my 400 time was 48 seconds, and getting better. I worked so hard. \n\nThen Covid shut down everything in March and that shit was stolen from me. Didn’t even have a graduation because I was in Georgia and my highschool was in Kansas. I was stuck and couldn’t be with my friends. When the graduation ceremony happened in July, I was 1000 miles away.\n\nLots of fucking resentment.",
