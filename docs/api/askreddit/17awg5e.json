I think it can be a creative and affordable way for people to travel the country long term, but the fantasy of selling all your earthly possessions to buy a $100k+ van and essentially be homeless is absurd and potentially dangerous. Many jurisdictions look down on it and you'll get constantly harassed. If you have kids you'll have protective services called on you. Parking and camping isn't always free and you'll be relying on satellite internet for remote work, which is not cheap. It's uncomfortable and you'll never truly have a \"safe space.\" \n\nIt's mostly a privileged wealthy fantasy for people whining about \"the grind.\" There's also the fact that if you're a young attractive influencer it is cute and actively encouraged- but if you're an older single person or poor, you're a vagrant and assumed to be a creep.\n\nI still want to fix up an old van and drive around the country, but FUCK doing it permanently- I will always have a homebase I can come home to.",
