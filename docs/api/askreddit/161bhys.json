A day or so later, I remembered the purse and took it in the house and handed it to my husband and told him to see who it belonged to. I go about doing stuff and came back in the living room and my coffee table was piled high with cash. He found the wallet, the money was in a crown royal bag, he found the checkbook and drugs, needles, coke, heroine, pot, there were transfer papers for a bar in town. The checkbook read like she was the county sheriff's best friend.. \"SO AND SO'S BAIL, SO AND SO'S FINES, SO AND SO COURT HEARING\". There was a bank deposit slip for the money. $4000.00. I put all the stuff back in the purse, kept the money, put the purse in a box and took the box to the bar where the lady worked. I threw the box on the bar porch  with a note in the box that said.. \"GOD BLESS YOU CAUSE HE SURE DID ME, NEXT TIME KEEP TRACK OF YOUR MONEY, HONEY!\".. The bar was a well known drug den..",
