There is no possible way for us to afford it. We do not have an \"extra\" 900 to 1400 of income to spend on shitty healthcare (this is the bare bones plastic tier). My wife and I are not even lower class (85k/yr). To further hammer in the point, it served absolutely no function at all unless my family hits a reserve out of pocket of like 3500 to 6000. This is more than my entire family has even spent on healthcare needs in the last five to ten years, and I am supposed to hit this mark annually. Fuck this shit! US healthcare is fucking about to implode on itself unless this gets sorted out.\n\nHealthcare.gov only offers assistance if you work somewhere where it isn't offered. It wouldn't matter anyways because according to Uncle Sam, my wife and I make too much. You kidding me? We have two paid-for vehicles, share a living space with my sister and her family, have eliminated most of our debt, and we are still living paycheck to paycheck.",
