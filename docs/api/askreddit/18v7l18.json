   "message": "1) Quit worrying about the other people who don't matter, and make sure the ones who do matter to you aren't toxic. Everyone tries to saddle everyone else with all these expectations and judgements. It's garbage. If you're doing your best where you are, it'll be alright so don't let it eat at you.\n\n2) Get organized and focused. You don't have to know what you want to do or be, but you should take the opportunity to get yourself together so that your planning, organization, and follow through skills are strong enough that as you do figure out meaningful goals and objectives, you can march forward toward them effectively. (Read The 7 Habits, one of the few self help books that isn't wimpy fluff)\n\n3) Take care of your body. Eat well and get regular exercise. There are so many ways to do something active that you don't have an excuse because you are unable to afford a gym or hating running. Also get good consistent sleep.\n\n4) Treat yourself and other people with respect. That means being kind when its appropriate, not being jealous or petty, and caring (at appropriate levels) for others, being helpful, courteous, etc.\n\n5) Acknowledge your debts to others even if you can't 'repay' them. If you show some promise, other people will try and help you, be appreciative, acknowledge and show appreciation. Do it for others when you can.\n\n6) Do things, try things, talk to people, read - basically learn. That's how you figure it out to the extent anyone ever does.\n\nLife is a marathon, building one you're proud of takes a long time and a lot of effort. You have to trust that doing good things the right way will always get you where you were meant to be. And you have to remember there is no script or map for a human life. So ideas about what you should be doing or where you should be are not generally useful or meaningful. As long as you are doing things, and doing your best to do them the right way (be respectful, care, put in effort, etc) then your life will turn out to be baller, for you, regardless of the trials and tribulations.",
