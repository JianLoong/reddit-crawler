Over the years, I held various occupations, such as a lawyer, a painter, a pianist, a doctor, a professor, etc. I made it a point to never stay in one place for more than 20 years.\n\nI could move and uproot myself and relive high school and college all over again. I acquired many degrees at various universities throughout my life.\n\nI accumulated vast wealth over the years and was able to enjoy life and just travel and explore the world and not be beholden to a 9 to 5 job.\n\nI saw humanity go through various wars. I saw technology increase at a rapid pace that artificial intelligence rendered most occupations obsolete. Governments imposed a form of universal basic income that people were then able to live simple lives and pursue their passions and leisure activities. \n\nI also saw humanity enter a period of dark ages as wars and tyranny wreaked havoc. Technology was destroyed and our education systems were weakened. Chaos ensued. Centuries later, monarchies and kings emerged.\n\nI don't know how I died. Some say that I traveled to another realm and was reincarnated to another dimension. \n\nYes, I have a wild imagination.",
