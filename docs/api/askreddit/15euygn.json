They're culturally X religion, but they do not read the texts, they do not devote themselves to following the practices, or following the tenets. They wear the symbols, identify as being that religion - but they aren't actually practicing their faith. \n\nI believe the Archbishop of Canterbury said, \"Being born in a garage doesn't make you a car.\" In other words, go to a church doesn't make you a Christian. \n\nMost religions have fairly good tenets that if practiced earnestly would be largely beneficial. Even though they may have some stupid ideas, much of it is offset by other ideas and requirements of the faith. \n\nIt's the culturally religious folks that end up being extremists or cherry picking their beliefs to let them abuse others, etc.",

It's very effective for controlling the masses for better or for worse.\n\nSometimes the results are good (like people not killing each other because it's against their religion), but sometimes the results are bad (like hindering science because it's against their religion). I naively believed that if you removed religion, people would gain the ability to finally think rationally and logically instead of worshiping dogma spread by others.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of worshiping God, they instead worship identity politics and radical political agendas. They substituted the church of Christianity for the church of woke, which in practice, is a hell of a lot more harmful than modern Christianity and so far, without any of the regulatory safeguards like separation of church and state.\n\nSimilarly, in communist countries that banned religion, they replaced worshiping God with worshiping the State and/or its leader.\n\nHistory has now shown that the masses will never be able to rationally and logically think for themselves.

Devas and magical beings are the same in Buddhism. One can experience them but they are not \"real\". To quote my Tibetan Buddhist teacher, a classically trained Lama: Buddha and these beings are archetypes, not gods. If you still hold onto the idea that Buddha is a god, you need to find yourself another teacher. You won't get any gods from me.",
