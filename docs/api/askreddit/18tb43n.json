As such, I think that these kids will suffer heavily when it comes to biology and other STEM areas. \n\nA substantial amount of homeschool curriculum skews white conservative.

Also the Civil War wasn‚Äôt about Slavery.‚Äù Thus I think the kids learning this curriculum will have issues understanding objective history and thus the ramifications that history has on the current day. \n\nHomeschooling is dangerously unregulated.

This is objectively a bad thing. \n\nNow your mileage will vary depending on the curriculum you end up getting, but ultimately I don‚Äôt feel comfortable knowing that children are being educated in a system where such objectively incorrect curriculum is in circulation.",

   "message": "I was raised homeschooled and I think I turned out pretty well. My parents were/are public school/college educators, and they decided what was offered in our state was kind of restrictive. Especially government, history, economics, stuff like that. It was usually taught with bias from one side of the other and they wanted us to be able to understand all sides. We were raised religious, but we were never taught to deny or ignore scientific theories, ‚Äòfacts‚Äô, etc. just because it wasn‚Äôt dictated in the Bible. In fact most all of my siblings except one are going into various scientific fields. When we got to high school, we were dual enrolled at the local college for the afore-mentioned subjects so we could see different points and sides being taught first hand.\n\nMy older - early to mid 20‚Äôs- siblings are getting their PHD‚Äôs/ masters, and half of us double majored (one triple majored) in the sciences. \n\nNot that there‚Äôs not downsides. Unless you‚Äôve got a decent sized co-op or something like that, you often have a pretty small social circle, and usually higher scholarships and awards don‚Äôt get awarded to homeschoolers unless they‚Äôre the ultra competitive type that‚Äôs involved in stuff, and usually at that point in they‚Äôre in public school as much or more as they are home, and a lot of people stop homeschooling at high school. Being awkward around peers is a reality. \n\nA lot of people think that homeschoolers end up going to Christian colleges and stuff like that, but the actual amount is much lower. I only know maybe 5 people who went to one, and there‚Äôs multiple dozens of families all over the religious, political, and social spectrums homeschooling in the community, equaling hundreds of kids. A lot of people who attend those types of colleges aren‚Äôt religious in the slightest, they just did it for a somewhat private college. \n\nThere are upsides too. I personally get along with most people, am more comfortable in conversations with older people, don‚Äôt really care about what peers think, don‚Äôt really care about awards and stuff like that since it wasn‚Äôt a thing for me. My personal interests and education were prioritized, since there wasn‚Äôt a entire class, just 6 of us. \n\n\nI would say none of us were ‚Äòindoctrinated‚Äô, and most of us get along just as well with people of completely different beliefs and political views as us, as ones who believe the same stuff we do.\n\nI‚Äôm not trying to say this is the same for everyone, I‚Äôve heard horror stories of parents just having their teenage kids memorize multiplication tables to rattle off if someone asked what they learned homeschooling. But I think it‚Äôs a pretty big generalization that it‚Äôs just conservatives who are indoctrinating their kids with religion and their political values and not giving them a proper education. \n\nYou would be surprised at the number of very non conservative families that homeschool. Before someone replies with surveys/studies, yes, it‚Äôs probably a heavily conservative leaning statistic. But I see a huge amount of homeschooled students not leaning the way their parents did. If they were raised religious, they often are very unreligious themselves, many come out as gay, bi, trans, etc. \nA huge proportion of families stop homeschooling at high school, so they‚Äôre suddenly introduced to all this stuff that they didn‚Äôt grow up with, and it makes them rethink how they were schooled, often for the better. \n\nA stereotype is that all homeschoolers are socially stunted, have no people skills, and stuff like that, and are behind education wise. At this point, it‚Äôs hard to be behind whatever grade you‚Äôre in. Listen to some public school teachers for high school and younger. Most, or at least a good deal, have a social circle, even if it‚Äôs small, and many have co-ops. \nI really don‚Äôt worry about homeschooled students taking public positions and ‚Äòruining‚Äô the country ( anymore than it is). Those that stay relatively conservative and those that go on to be more liberal frankly seems somewhat equal. When you think about it, what really would be different? Conservatives will vote and run for conservatives, and ditto for liberals. \n\nTo bounce off what someone else commented, my mom, who‚Äôs degree is childhood behavior/development, also decided that we wouldn‚Äôt perform our best in public school. People learn/develop at different rates, and from what I‚Äôve seen so many public school teachers say, schools are advancing grades way too quickly for their capabilities.",

   "message": "I was one of those kids. I am now trans, bisexual, and as ‚Äúwoke‚Äù as can be. \nI live in the bible belt, and was homeschooled in a christian curriculum, from grades 8-12. The curriculum is called ‚Äúclassical conversations‚Äù. It absolutely sucks from an educational point of view, and the content has been burned into my brain. I‚Äôm still trying to unlearn it. \n\nThat was the most horrific time of my life, I was so, so lonely. I met up with other homeschoolers every Monday but I couldn‚Äôt relate to anyone up there, they were all super conservative and christian, and I was a closeted queer teen. (More on that later.) So I had no friends at all in high school. When our group met, we had an actual class, to make sure everyone was completing their work during the rest of the week. Also, side note, lots of families at that co-op had at least 4 children. One family even had 11 children. I don‚Äôt know why, but it was super common for families to have lots and lots of kids, and then homeschool them all under Classical Conversations. \n\nI am fucking SHOCKED that nobody has spoken out about Classical Conversations. That program is raising the next generation of Ben Shapiros. We learned to debate and even had a mock trial in a real courthouse at one point. We learned logic and fallacies. All of this is well and good, but I think it‚Äôs very ironic that they‚Äôre heavily encouraging kids to ‚Äúsee both points of view‚Äù while simultaneously forcing their views down those kids‚Äô throats. üòê\n\nThe co-op leaders were also wildly homophobic and transphobic. They straight up said in the rules, if you‚Äôre gay, trans, and/or you dress in clothes that don‚Äôt match your gender, you aren‚Äôt allowed to take this curriculum. That caused me so many panic attacks as a teenager because I knew I was queer. I never felt welcome at the co-op or in the curriculum, I always felt like I was pretending. And in addition to this, I was being taught that queer people were abominations, and they belonged in hell. I‚Äôd google over and over, ‚Äúdoes god love gay people?‚Äù ‚Äúis homosexuality a sin?‚Äù I had so many sleepless nights where I‚Äôd just toss and turn, wondering if I‚Äôd ever get to be myself, and be loved for who I am, because I was worried about what God and my family would think. (But no, this isn‚Äôt indoctrination, true indoctrination is teaching kids that queer people exist!!! /s)\n\nThe worst books in the course are, by far, the ‚ÄúApologia Science‚Äù textbooks and the religious book ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt just happen‚Äù which we used as a textbook and even memorized passages from. \n\nApologia Science‚Äôs textbooks had some true information, but they tried to back it all up with bizarre lies. For example global warming. They claimed that global warming isn‚Äôt real, because the earth is ‚Äúself-regulating‚Äù. (And like, okay, sure, I guess the earth will ‚Äúself-regulate‚Äù us right off of its surface if we continue polluting it. /s)\n\n‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt just happen‚Äù was an awful book about how the universe just lined up too perfectly to be a coincidence. It went into detail trying to disprove evolution, while also making big claims about our universe. It entirely fucked up my belief in science as a teenager. One of the worst things that book did was, IT TRIED DISPROVING CARBON DATING. They wanted us to believe that the world is only 10,000 years old so they cast doubt on the concept of carbon dating. I swear to god this curriculum is custom-made to pump out science deniers.\n\nAnyways, these books and the curriculum as a whole are so much worse than I can convey in a reddit comment. I‚Äôve considered making a video essay on youtube about it, or maybe requesting/commissioning a video essayist to make one in my stead. I have soooooo fucking many stories and facts to tell about this curriculum.",

Most of these families who are switching do fit the demographics of a more traditional nuclear family with a mother who does not work full time. However, I see a lot of dads taking on the home school parent role and even forgoing their careers to be the home parent in these traditional examples. \n\nWhat does this mean for the future? \nThe current college students cannot read above a middle school level in much of my experience working with public and private education. The pandemic worsened conditions that were developing on their own. The emphasis on testing - which is how teachers get their bonuses and raises - is detrimental to students‚Äô ability to read and comprehend complex ideas. STEM programs have been pushed to the detriment of humanities, which is bad for language skills overall and is now causing huge issues with literacy, to the detriment of all fields everywhere. \nMost homeschool programs are built around the humanities and philosophy rather than ‚Äúpractical‚Äù science like chemistry. In high school, however, my experience of science was no different in a classroom than at home aside from a handful of lab experiments. I took chemistry in school and learned almost nothing, but could do geometry and algebra without a calculator because I learned it from a homeschool curriculum that prioritized conceptual learning. \n\nWhile people like to talk about homeschoolers being poorly adjusted or socialized or whatever, the majority of states have pretty strict rules about what passes and what does not. There are checks and balances and coops for support. Not all will succeed, some kids will have to repeat a grade, and I‚Äôve seen some religious families basically study the Bible and nothing else, and struggle as a result. \n\nThe homeschoolers who end up in college classes, in my experience, usually stand at the top because they are accustomed to building their own schedule, working at their own pace, and studying independently of a teacher being readily accessible. Not all homeschoolers have the advantages of co-ops and accountability structures that guide parents, so mileage may vary. Overall, I encourage a lot of people to try it out when they‚Äôre not finding success in overcrowded public schools or overpriced private schools. It‚Äôs a great option to lighten the load so kids who will never have that sort of one-on-one opportunity can receive a better education in a less burdened system.",

We have been absolutely failed by the government, our parents and our communities. I personally think homeschooling should be banned and we should make our schools more accommodating (unrealistic in America but absolutely possible). My siblings and I are lucky that we managed to figure out that what happened to us was incredibly fucked up and abusive and now we can take steps to help ourselves. But most homeschool alumni I know have not figured this out they don‚Äôt realize they were neglected/abused/isolated and essentially raised in a cult and they go on to continue the cycle of abuse.

Why do think you are more qualified than an entire school system? No sane person thinks they can give a child (yet alone multiple) an entire k-12 education.

They put me not only in sixth grade, but in all advanced classes. I skipped 5th all together. I quickly fell behind in English as I hadn't studied enough to spell correctly and I still had an accident. I also found it difficult to understand the Georgia English where we moved to from Germany. I was put back in a regular class.\n\nBack then it didn't matter what the subject was you'd get bad grades if you didn't spell correctly. That's not the case anymore at least for public school in California for my children. \n\nThe homeschool co-op I was a part of was super efficient. There was like 30 of us, all different ages and grades, two teachers for general subjects. An art teacher, a music teacher, physical education coach, drama teacher, home studies (like keeping a house, not quite home economics), physical sciences teacher (lab work who also taught gardening or perhaps that was just for the youngest), we had a full staff of seemingly specialized instructors. We didn't have any non English languages to learn which I found strange. \n\nMy point is, some homeschool is basically private school quality, or can be.

There are a lot of different reasons why it happens, from cultish religious sects (I see you, Duggars and your child abuse manual) to general neglect and not caring for their kids. The vast lack of oversight though is being used to keep children away from mandated reporters, so there‚Äôs nobody they can report the abuse to, and they fill their kids with fear about CPS coming to their door and taking them away, insisting they target homeschooling families (and as someone who‚Äôs worked inside Illinois‚Äô CPS organization, the number of time homeschooling families came up was‚Ä¶.zero). It really is a mess, and the lack of oversight that the ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù over at the HSLDA (homeschool legal defense association, otherwise known as child abuse enablers) pushed for and made possible is a huge reason why that happens, and as a Christian it absolutely disgusts me.

Fixed gender identity is a social construct, much the same as **a diversity of gender identity.** This means that societies that have a \"boy\" and \"girl\" customary are just as valid as societies that allow for the existence of 82 genders. However, when under the guise of education, we frame one as morally correct, and the other as morally reprehensible - I'm sorry that's just a purely political take being openly talked about in the classroom.\n\nI could continue with those list of issues, but I worry that in our hunt to chase down and allow acceptance in the classroom, we've created a situation that's removed the possibility of acceptance of diversity of thought in a classroom. Children come from different backgrounds, and should be educated about issues in an unbias manner. Education has a liberal skew that does not allow for this outright; and some conservatives see this as a reason to entirely remove their children from the system because they believe it's a system that no longer coincides with their way of life.\n\nIt's a normal human response to do this with your children; **especially** if you feel that the values you'd like them to have are being compromised.",

The college I went to for some reason attracted a TON of homeschoolers, many of which you could spot from a mile away. At least 50% of them completely lacked any social skills or critical thinking ability. Many of them were extremely gullible and some were emotionally immature.\n\nHOWEVER, as homeschooling becomes more and more popular you are seeing a rise in homeschooling groups where different homeschooling families get together and attempt to give their kids a more traditional high school experience. They go on field trips and participate in music, theater, sports, etc. It‚Äôs hard work but if you can commit yourself to doing it properly I think many of those kids will come out better than the ones going through the public education system. \n\nYou don‚Äôt need to look very far to see the failings of the public school system from teachers blowing the whistle on how little their kids know to the fact your average person is a complete moron.",
