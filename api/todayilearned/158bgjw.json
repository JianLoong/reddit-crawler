So they may not look fat and may not be classified as overweight in the BMI, but having visceral fat is a major risk factor for diabetes.\n\nPlus Vietnam is a relatively poor country compared so some of its Asia-Pacific neighbors, so it makes sense for them to be skinny.",

East Asians are *supposed* to be of thinner build genetically, and the guideline is roughly BMI=27-28 instead of 30 for them. However, this global statistic seems to use 30 for everyone.\n\nUsing the BMI=30 guideline makes all overweight East Asians appear healthier than they are. An East Asian with BMI=27/28 will suffer about as much health harm as a White person with BMI=30. \n\nThis helps explain why Vietnam's obesity is even lower than other much poorer nations. Simply put, a BMI=29 Vietnamese ought to be considered obese, and suffers roughly the same amount of health harm as a BMI=32 White person, but the statistic does not count it as such.\n\nFYI, I myself am an East Asian with a BMI=27 East Asian GF. She really is about as flabby as a BMI=30 white woman. We're just built different.",
