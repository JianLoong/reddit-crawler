IGF has a policy that games can only win awards on the year they come out, but Fez (despite being not that amazing) won awards on 2008 and the grand prize in 2012, IGF claiming the 2008 version was a demo and therefore not the same version. The judges had a clear motive to give the grand prize to Phil Fish, since they stood to directly profit from the success of his studio, effectively funding it further through ticket sales and other sources of income related to the IGF event.\n\nPhil Fish then also went on to bash literally the entirety of Japanese games, saying that they suck because of the UI, among other things that sound awfully similar to western game journalists bashing Elden Ring for its UI and game design a decade later.\n\nPhil Fish's studio's private files were leaked to 4chan, likely from a pissed off employee, which is how this was all exposed.\n\nOld expos√©: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ON-oL4Mlks\u0026amp;ab\\_channel=ShortFatOtaku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ON-oL4Mlks\u0026amp;ab_channel=ShortFatOtaku)",
