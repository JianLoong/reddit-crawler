And the formula followed isn't even for a successful song like pop or whatever, it's attributes of the genre slapped together. \n\nBlast beats, unintelligible harsh vocals, tremelo picking (for black, and some death), dissonant sound that never comes together or varies, bad mixing and recording quality because hearing the song you're listening to is for losers apparently. \n\nAnd then the best riffs you've ever heard in your life (for death metal, and some black) that the band spent God knows how long workshopping that make you think: \"I wish they had an ounce of songwriting ability because then this would be fucking awesome\"",
