Think about from his point of view.\n\nBe Putin.\n\nBe thinking real hard:\n\n\"For reasons definitely not my fault, the age distribution in Russia is \"oh fuck\" level bad, with an incoming dip in the working age male bracket that would scupper any economy without drastic action. \n\nNow, I think we can all agree that you can't just wave a wand around and get people to relocate to your country. Haha! Hilarious. How are you supposed to threaten people before they move here? Silly hypothetical. \n\nAnyway, you can only kidnap so many babies and give them to russian alcoholics before you (I) remember that I've sent half the parents to the front. And also run out of babies. Because the invasion failed catastrophically. Shit.\n\nWell, we can't fill in the dip, so what are we going to do?\"\n\nBe us, considering putins dilemma.\n\nHave you spotted the solution yet? Of course you have,  you're a genius! \n\nWe just need to \"dip\" the other age brackets even more! Perfect! Soon Putin will have an age distribution any country would drool over.\n\nPerfectly straight, with tens of males in every age bracket, and plenty of women per male so that even the drones to stupid to leave will have a chance to procreate.\n\nAnd all it cost him was the derision of some trolls on the Internet, whatever military equipments left, and some bullets to shoot russians as they try to abandon their posts. \n\nSee?\n\nPerfectly rational!",
