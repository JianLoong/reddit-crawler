To simulate the uncomfortable situation of being late to a meeting, have everyone assemble in that room when visitors arrive and pretend a presentation is being given. The presentation may be paused and the person asked, \"So-and-so, do you have anything to add?\" Do you have the documents I requested? Insist that everyone already present gaze uncomfortably and in silence at the newcomer. You may also build some dummies to add some permanent office workers by filling pants and collared or polo shirts with newspaper. It's possible to use the heads as components for Halloween masks.",
