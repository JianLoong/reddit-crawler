We want you to get your meds. We want you to be healthy. And we **KNOW** the meds and drugs. Better than your doctor in most cases. A PHARMACIST is a doctor of drugs and medicine. Your CARDIOLOGIST (or whatever specialist) is a doctor of the heart. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt know the meds, but toe to toe, the PharmD or RPh will smoke them on the effects, info, route of metabolization, efficacy, time of absorption, side effects, warnings, counter actions, etc etc etc every time. Much like how the Cardio would smoke a Pharm on heart repeated issues. Listen to the expert, but recognize that just because your doc specializes in a certain field, that doesn‚Äôt mean they know everything about the meds. That‚Äôs the Pharmacists and pharmacy‚Äôs job. \n\nAlso, tell every doc what you are taking. They can‚Äôt help you if you hide info. Same with your pharmacist. Yeah, I smoke weed too. Yes, I also drink. Yes, I tell my doctor that. Because at the end of the day, we all can assist in getting you well all the faster with all the facts. \n\nNOTE:  I‚Äôm no longer in pharmacy, but while I was, I caught mistakes daily because person X didn‚Äôt tell the doc they were also on XYZ for their whatever or ‚Äúit‚Äôs not THAT doctor‚Äôs business that I‚Äôm on the pill‚Äù.  Yes, it is. Mine too. The more we know the quicker we can assist and get you back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. And the less likely we are to kill you or make you sicker.\n\n**EDIT:** a word.
