   "message": "So, this happened to me on this solo hike I took a while back. It started off as this perfect day, clear skies, just me and the great outdoors. I was feeling pretty pumped, you know, just exploring and enjoying the peace and quiet.\n\nBut, out of nowhere, this crazy storm rolls in. I mean, it was intense ‚Äì dark clouds, crazy winds, the works. I found this spot under some trees to wait it out, thinking it would pass quickly. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThen, get this, a bolt of lightning strikes super close to me, like one of those 'you could feel the electricity in the air' close. And just when I thought it couldn't get any scarier, this massive tree next to me gets hit and starts falling right towards me. I'm not kidding, it was like a scene from a movie.\n\nI literally had to dive out of the way. It was nuts! The tree crashed down right where I was a second ago. I was just lying there on the ground, heart pounding, thinking, \"Did that just happen?\"\n\nAfter that, I was pretty shaken up, but thankfully, I wasn't hurt. Once the storm cleared, I booked it out of there. That whole experience was insane, and it really made me appreciate, you know, being alive and all that. Nature's no joke, guys. I've got a whole new respect for it after that day.",

About 4pm ish my dad walks through the door and surprises me and my friend with a new Xbox 360 game. Lo and behold it is MW2 which wouldn‚Äôt release for another 4 days. This sounds far fetched but even to this day my best friend constantly reminds me of it and how jealous he was. I remember playing the campaign with him and we got to the cliffhanger mission and his mum arrived to take him home as he played the final part where you drive the snow mobile down the mountain and finish the mission. \n\nI honestly have no idea how my dad got the game early, I distinctly remember my friend saying ‚Äú how have you got this , it‚Äôs not even out yet ‚Äú and I didn‚Äôt even ask any questions I just wanted to play it. \n\nSo yeah I guess I‚Äôve experienced the first couple missions of MW2 before anyone else ?",

I thought that was super cool and a one time experience, they even gave me an award after helping out on of our top scientists after a huge feud she had with the director of my department and I somehow convinced her to stay with our company instead of going back to Germany.
