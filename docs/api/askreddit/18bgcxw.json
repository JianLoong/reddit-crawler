Not big ones like sleeping around or staying with their parents for weeks, the slow burn like if you both have a rule in the house that only one alarm is set for the convenience of the other sleeper, and they start going back to their old habit of setting three or four or ten alarms to wake up: they are not taking consideration of your needs and are doing it passive aggressively. Same thing if they start regularly cooking shared meals with ingredients they like but know you hate, or inviting over people who dislike you and you can't stand.",
