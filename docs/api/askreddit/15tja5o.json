Are you tragically uneducated?\n3. Brake vs. break. You brake your car to stop with its brakes. You take a break at work. You break my heart with this kind of misuse!\n4. Your vs. You're. Your is for something that belongs to you. You're is a contraction of \"you are\".\n5. Placing the dollar sign after the amount.  It's $20, not 20$.\n6. Overuse of abbreviations. It's fine that some have become part of common Reddit vocabulary, like TIL and MIRL. The overuse occurs in posts and comments about technical subjects, or esoteric hobbies. The poster or commenter may be trying to communicate \"If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand \", but it's a missed opportunity to communicate clearly to a larger audience, rather than just those already in the know.",
