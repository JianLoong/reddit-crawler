   "message": "[Bobbit worms](https://youtu.be/K_7ByiYbCYM?si=FnKSzFuuyu54wYqn). They look like something out of a hell dimension, they range from 4 inches to 10 FEET long, and their jaws are so powerful that they can snap fish in half. \n\nAnd what’s worse about them compared to a lot of the answers in this thread is that *you can end up with a Bobbit worm in your at home saltwater aquarium by accident*. They like to live in holes of large rocks, which are also popular among aquarium enthusiasts to use as decor, or hide inside the substrate at the bottom of an aquarium. As they are ambush predators who are mostly active at night, you probably won’t figure out that there’s one inside your aquarium until you notice fish have started to go missing. \n\nThese worms are almost impossible to get rid of out of your large aquarium rocks, as they can cling so tightly to the hole they’re in that you can’t pull them out. They’re also really good at hiding in small spaces. If you tear the worm apart trying to get it out (which is pretty easy to do) the leftover part inside the rock hole can regenerate into a new Bobbit worm. [Here’s the story of a poor aquarist who found a Bobbit worm in his tank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/zf4uez/nonreddit_the_bobbit_worm_chronicles/)",

   "message": "It's hard to pick scariest, but [sperm whales](https://a-z-animals.com/blog/sperm-whale-vs-orca-who-would-win-in-a-fight/) are my vote for a top-tier scary ocean creature. Humans have nothing to fear - sperm whales have never been known to eat us - but that's because they choose not to. The link is about sperm whales vs. orcas, also an incredibly scary animal if it wants to kill you (similarly to sperm whales, wild orcas essentially never do).\n\n[Sperm whales are loud enough that they can probably kill a person with their clicks alone.](https://roaring.earth/sperm-whales-can-vibrate-humans-to-death/) If you look at the stats in my 1st link, you'll see they are huge, powerful predators. They have 8-inch teeth that are 2lbs each, and they kill other animals with single hits from their tails. I don't know if this makes them scarier, but they can survive [10,000 feet below the surface for up to 60 minutes](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/sperm-whale). The pressure there is over 300x that at the surface, and that's close to the depth where the [Titan submersible](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65934887) is believed to have imploded earlier this year.\n\nEdit: thanks to u/Squigglepig52, they pointed me towards [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsDwFGz0Okg) where a gentleman named James Nestor is talking about potentially lethal free dives with these monsters.\n\nSo you've got an intelligent 50-to-60-foot 45-ton master predator that can kill you with it's voice and hunt you down basically anywhere in the water. Including past the point where the pressure would kill you instantly.",
