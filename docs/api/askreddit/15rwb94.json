I lost contact with her after high school because she had a scary jealous boyfriend. She randomly added me on Facebook and asked for my phone number. I didn‚Äôt think it was a big deal so I sent it. She sent me a very graphic photo of herself and said ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs me crisi!‚Äù And I was like hot damnnnn. We talked for a bit that day, but that was our only real conversation. She had brought up our pact and we joked about it for a bit. A few months later she messaged me asking if she can use my shower because her water got shut off. I thought that was unusual so I just told her it wasn‚Äôt a good time. That‚Äôs happened to me before and I‚Äôd normally message a family member or close friend. A couple days later she posted a video of her and some dude (not her old boyfriend) smoking crack under a freeway overpass. She had a bandana on her face and the filmed themselves smoking head banging to music thinking they looked bad ass. I felt really bad for her at that point. Then I wondered if I had let her use my shower if she would‚Äôve robbed me with her cholo looking boyfriend. Not too long after that her boyfriend started posting online that she was missing and he can‚Äôt locate her. Two weeks after that he changed his status to single on Facebook and I still haven‚Äôt heard from my childhood friend. I hope she‚Äôs ok out there. Really hope she can get her shit together and get clean.",
