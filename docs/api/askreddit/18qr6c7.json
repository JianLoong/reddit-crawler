After the usual exchanges for this situation the officer told him to \"Go back to Mexico.\"\n\nMy friend's patience absolutely ran out and he bellowed back, \"I'm a Chumash. You're on my land. Go back to wherever you came from!\"\n\nChumash are the indigenous people of Malibu. The officer's tone changed completely, probably guessing this kid wouldn't talk this way unless he had connections with the tribal council--and figuring those connections could cause actual trouble with the officer's chain of  command, the officer actually apologized.",
