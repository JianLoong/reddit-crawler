Thank you Reddit for all the upvotes and the kind stranger for the award. I'm blown away. \n\nTo everyone who has experienced this kind of paralyzing heartbreak: you are obviously not alone and at least almost 5k strangers can totally relate to whatever it is you're going through or have gone through at some point. I does get easier some day, somehow, but you are never immune to experiencing it again. And thankfully so. Think of it this way, as clich√©d as it may sound: if your heart breaks, at least you know you've really loved. That is never a bad thing. üíúüíú",
