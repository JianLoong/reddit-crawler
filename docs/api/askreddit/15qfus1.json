I have a king size bed and only room for me. 😌 I love my pillows and want a few more.",

I’ve had back problems for a while, and I heard this helps keep the natural curvature of spine, so I tried it and it works great.\n\nI used to sleep on my stomach, but I heard sleeping on your back is better for you.
