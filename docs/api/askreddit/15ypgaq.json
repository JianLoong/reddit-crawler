   "message": "Diversity vice-president at university. It is a useless position for a problem that could be easily solved if universities wanted to do it. Do you know why Universities in Europe (not including the UK) are quite diverse? There is nothing subjective about choosing the applicants. Most countries have national exams at core subjects and with these results, plus their high school grades, everything get inserted into a formula, and you get ranked at national level. Universities have a number of vacancies per degree, and applicants rank their choices. An algorithm distributes the students based on the national ranking and the order of their choices. The result is a naturally diverse university system.",
