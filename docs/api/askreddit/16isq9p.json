This seems to mostly only affect young women, or at least young women I was attracted to in my youth.\n\nIn my early 20s I swear every girl I was interested in would say shit that I would figure out was really aggressively sexual like a month later but at the time I would just be so fucking literal about it. They'd then assume I picked up on it and rejected them, and then they'd ghost me. Months later we'd reconnect as friends and they'd be like \"remember that one time that I said X\" and I'd be like \"yeah and I assumed you *actually meant* X...ahaha ha ha\"\n\nDating since my late 20s or so women are usually more like \"so you wanna go somewhere and fuck?\" This is better.\n\nAs an example, a girl I had a severely painful crush on when I was 23 and I were at the bar and I mentioned I had an old school nintendo at my apartment. She said \"do you have Tetris?\" and I was like \"fuck yeah I have Tetris it's my favorite fucking game ever\" and she said \"I'm really good at making pieces fit\" and I said \"prove it, let's go to my place.\" We actually played Tetris. After a few matches she got mad and left. Took me like two weeks to figure out why.",
