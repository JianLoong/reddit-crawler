Most men don‚Äôt receive any compliments or attention. But when a line is drawn and crossed, it becomes extremely uncomfortable.

I think it's fuckin' cool, honestly.\n\nBack when I had long hair and more of a bubble butt, dude's would catcall me thinking I was a chick all the time, and I can't tell you how many of them wanted to fight as soon as they realized that I was a dude. It was always hilarious when it was in front of another male friend and they'd get violent, and I could say they wanted to fight me because they really wanted to fuck me. üòÇ",
