Hygiene and modest, yet nicely fit, clothing. Gives the idea that you at least have some self awareness of how you look/smell.\n3. Physical workout. Because nobody ever said \"I bet that guy that regularly goes to the gym and has a healthy physique is lazy and undisciplined\".\n4. Care. Care for real. Listen and help people out however you can with all your heart. It's probably the #1 trait another lonely person really wants in a partner. This is 4th and hardest by quite an colossal margin compared to all the rest. Easy to say when unchallenged but I saw men clean the beds of their hospitalized wives of poop and piss and blood while staying up nights besides them taking care of their every need.",
