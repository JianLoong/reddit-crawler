 "selftext": "My friend and I got married one month apart. She got married first, and my husband (fianc√© at the time) and I gifted her and her husband $650. I was a bridesmaid at her wedding, and she is a very close friend of mine, so I felt like this was an appropriate amount.\n\nFast forward to our wedding, they are the only people to show up with an actual gift. We specifically asked for no items, and that their presence would be enough but a cash gift would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSo they gifted us a toaster oven, and we realized it was an opened toaster oven (most likely regifted from their wedding). It was very clearly opened and put back into the box.\n\nShe knows I am moving over 2,000 miles away and there is absolutely no way we could bring that over. It also feels like a slap to the face. I rather she had only written a card or not given anything at all. AITAH for feeling this way? Or should I be grateful she gave me something?",
