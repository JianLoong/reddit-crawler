 "title": "AITAH for moving out of my parents house after they sold my property? And if so what should I do next",
 "selftext": "I (18m) moved out of my parents house and moved in with my girlfriend after my mom (41f) sold my PC and all of my peripherals with it (all of those aproximated at about 2.7k USD dollars) with her and my dad's reasoning being my uncle's upcoming heart surgery, for a little background I genuinely got along great with my parents up until yesterday when I came home to find out that my pc and my peripherals were gone, (all of which were paid with my own money down to the last penny due to saving up some pretty nice winnings from my esports tournaments I participated in) upon confronting my mother, she explained to me that \"I had to pitch in for my uncle's surgery anyway and this was the fastest and easiest way\" completely forgetting that I did have my own bank account with even more winnings from the tournaments I participated in, my father is completely neutral about the whole situation, refusing to get involved, and today I moved in with my girlfriend after my mom villainised me to the rest of our extensive family \"for not wanting to pitch in with my savings for my uncle's surgery\" I have completely cut off contact with my mom and my dad is begging me to come back saying that he could fix things between me and my mom, ehat should I do and AITAH?\n\n\nUPDATE 1 (~3 days after the situation above happened): My mom refuses to talk to me now, saying that anything that was under her roof is hers to manage, my dad is still neutral as hell and i'm starting to consider more and more filing a report for theft, my uncle, aunt, grandmother and grandfather are very clearly on my side.\n\n\nUPDATE 2: My father has confirmed that he made sure that the PC was wiped clean before selling it, which also makes him a culprit now since I know without a shadow of doubt that he actively helped my mother sell my belongings, upon hearing \"small claims court\" he begged me to not do it and *almost* threatened me, my mother still refuses to talk to me, tomorrow i'm going back there to take any other personal belonging I had that was bought with my own money (also passport, birth certificate and so on as suggested by others here) ",
