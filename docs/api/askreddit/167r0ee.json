She killed hundreds by not allowing them medical treatment on purpose.  \n  \nHer reason was \"if god called you, you need to go\" as she moved people into the called Houses of Death. People literally dropped on the ground...  \n  \nYet when she got sick she immediately went to best hospital in the US. How was that \"god is calling you?\"",
