   "message": "Being very good-looking. We're wired to perceive facial symmetry and all that as signals for the innate quality of a person, but it ain't necessary so. Here's [one quick example](https://www.livescience.com/47322-facial-symmetry-sexy-health.html):\n\n\u0026gt;In the new study, researchers examined 4,732 British 15- and 16-year-olds whose health had been tracked since birth as part of the United Kingdom's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The researchers analyzed three-dimensional scans of teens' faces, looking for symmetry, and compared those findings to health measures including birth weight, childhood health problems, body mass index (BMI) and even IQ at age 8. The results showed no links between health and facial symmetry. Asymmetry was not related to more childhood ailments, nor to a lower birth weight or higher BMI, Pound told Live Science. Low birth weight and high BMI have each been linked with numerous health problems. There was a tiny correlation between greater symmetry and higher IQ, but the link accounted for less than 1 percent in the variation of IQs seen in the sample, Pound said. The weakness of the link makes it unlikely that facial symmetry has any real-world value in gauging someone's intelligence.",
