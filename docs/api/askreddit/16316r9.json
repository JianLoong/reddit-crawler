   "message": "\nBit of background. When my wife was young,  her parents and siblings lived with one set of her grandparents. Her grandfather was murdered in the home.  It happened in his bedroom upstairs.  The room was used primarily as storage for the next 20+ years. Her parents tried to sell the house multiple times, but living in a small town, everyone knew and the house would not sell, so they stayed. \n\nYears later, and while my wife and I were engaged, there was a murder trial which I attended in support of her family.  I saw the crime scene photos (important later). \n\nAnother few years later, we had 2 kids, the oldest was 6 at the time.  My wife's family does not talk about the murder, and our kids do not know about the murder to this day.  \n\nMy FIL decided he wanted the room where the murder happened to be a hangout for the grandkids when the family was in town.  He put sleeping bags and a tv in the room ahead of a holiday, days-long get-together. We didn't like it but stayed silent since the murder was a sore subject.  My FIL also wanted all the grandkids to all sleep in there together. \n\nWe were the first to arrive and my son went into the room alone.  He usually couldn't sit still long at that age, so after a couple of hours I decided to check in on him.  Here is our conversation: \n\nDuring the whole converstation, he was still and rigid and would not look away from the tv.  \n\"Hey buddy, is everything ok up here?\"  \n\"Yeah.\"  \n\"Ok, have fun!\" \n\"Daddy, do I have to sleep in here?  I don't want to.\"  \n\"Why not?\"  \n\"I am not alone.\"  Every hair on my body stood up. \n\"Well yeah, I'm here with you buddy!\" \n\"No, there is someone in here with us\"  \n\"Are they nice? Mean? A grown-up?  A kid?\"  \n\"A grown-up.\"\n\"What are they doing right now?\" \n\"They are watching you.\"  \n\"You have never said anything like this at your grandparent's house before and you have been here a lot.\"  \n\"They don't leave this room and I have never been in here before.\" \n\"Where are they now?\" Without looking away from the tv, he points to the far corner where his great-grandfather was murdered and said, \"they are standing over there. They don't move much.\"  \n\"Ok buddy, you don't have to stay in here,\" and he left the room with me. ",

   "message": "Ex husbands family owns a massive farmhouse that was built in the late 1800's and has been passed down through generations. They inherited from a pair of bachelor brothers and their sister, \"Aunt Kate\". So it goes she died in the attic so thats why you hear pacing up there at night. She loves to take things like exMil's jewelry and move it around the house.\n\nThe music room used to be used as the funeral parlor for that area way back in the day. They had the original furnace in the basement that looked big enough to burn bodies. One time I came home and noticed my cat was halfway off the ottoman kneeding with his paws like something not there was petting him and holding the front half of him. I went over and ran my hand under him but not touching him and he fell down. \n\nEx was woken up one night with a lady in white standing over him staring down at him. Ex is an electrician/farmer who wouldnt make shit up. \n\nAunt Kates room that she once lived in is freezing cold all year round. Theres no a/c and it gets hot and humid in that house. One time I slept in there and had 7 quilts on in the middle of summer. I went to bed with the door closed, they all squeek loudly when opened and the wood floors squeek too. In the middle of the night I sort of woke up feeling hands going up and down me tucking the blankets in my sides like you do with little kids. I opened my eyes even though I was terrified and nothing was there. The door was open too which would have woken me up from loud squeek.\n\nEx remarried and had a daughter who always sees an old man in overalls at the top of the stairs who doesnt wznt her to go up. Shes 10 now and has seen him constantly since she was little.",

She lived in a duplex.\n\nWhile I was standing in the living room with her and her girls talking about how the rest of the night would go, a little boy in full snow gear came in through her front door, stomped through the living room past us and headed down the stairs to the basement. The mom never even looked at him or stopped talking. The girls didn’t make any acknowledgement that they saw him.\n\nI was super weirded out but I was also an extremely introverted teenager so I didn’t ask the mom what was up. \n\nOnce the mom left, I asked the girls who the little boy was that came in and they both had no idea what I was talking about. So I got brave and grabbed a broom and headed downstairs. It was a small unfinished basement, one single room with no closets or anything.\n\nNo one was down there and the little boy definitely had not come back upstairs in that time.\n\nSo, so weird and the only time I have truly believed I experienced something paranormal; I normally scoff at ghost stories and stuff.",

   "message": "I have a haunted house in SC.\n\nIt’s an old plantation house that is abandoned now but we still own it.\n\nOne time we heard something jump off of a bed upstairs and footsteps right after. Like a dog. But the only dog in the house was right next to my feet. This sound repeated every 10 ish minutes for at least an hour. Only after I checked the room did the sound stop.\n\nAnother time I was home alone and heard a loud crash. Like something got smashed. I ran to the dining room (where I heard the noise) and the giant painting above the fireplace was on the ground very broken. However, the giant nail holding the painting in place was still there, at an upward angle. The string to the panting was still intact. The ONLY way that painting would have fallen is if something picked it up and smashed it. I then thought there was someone in the house, so I called the cops. This giant ex-football SC trooper showed up, tough as nails kind of guy. He searched the house with me, had his gun drawn, and was visibly shaking. He dropped his gun twice, shaking. He left shortly after not finding anyone, and floored it out of the driveway.\n\nAnother time I was lying in bed sick, and there is a closet with an old door handle. It’s also really hard to open. It had a giant latch and the wood door grinds against the floor. So here I am, in bed, and the handle starts turning. The door opens, just a crack, but it opened. Idk how, but it fucking happened. I ignored it and went to bed, thinking it was a dream and I was just sick dreaming (you know how those dreams can get crazy). Well I wasn’t dreaming because when I woke up boom it was still open.\n\nThe next day, still in bed sick, I remember vividly my right hand trying to strangle me. I know that sounds crazy but I was choking myself and I couldn’t stop. I had to use my left hand to stop myself. Eventually I regained control of my right arm/hand but I never forgot what happened. Same room, same bedroom (it was the master bedroom).\n\nAnother time I remember seeing a young girl walk the halls. She was wearing a blue dress and had blonde hair. She never did anything to me, didn’t scare me, she was just there. She disappeared after walking into the green room (a room with green walls, this house has like 5 living rooms).\n\nThere is also a graveyard next to the property. Over time the land was sold off, so we don’t actually own the graveyard. In the graveyard there are graves going back to the 1700’s and there is a grave of a baby. Definitely the original owners of the house.\n\nWe also got shot at by a crazy neighbor one Fourth of July. His name was Willy. Why do I know this? He came to our front porch one time, shirtless, to introduce himself. He had a giant scar on his back. He asked us to make sure to put away the lawnmower because people might try to steal it. (The lawn mower was on the other side of the property, hidden, the only way he could have known we had one was if he was wandering our property.) Anyways, he shot at us, barely missing my brother in the head. Willy’s house burned down shortly after, with him in it.\n\nWe don’t go back there anymore :/\n\nEdit: spellchecks",

I’ve had squirrels and mice in my walls before and know how they sound, this was different. It would start right by my head and slowly make its way up the wall to the ceiling then turn and start down the other wall on the opposite side of my bed. Every night for like a month this would happen but I was so exhausted, I would just force myself to sleep.\n\nThen it all came to a head one night: the tapping/scratches would start as normal up the wall but then it stopped when it got to the ceiling. Next thing I know something has LANDED on the tops of my blanketed legs. It felt like a cat or something. I screamed, turned on the light and tore out of bed. Nothing was there. I checked the entire room, under the bed..in the closet. Nothing. I slept down on the couch that night.\n\nThe next night the scratches/tapping starts up *again* on my wall but I had had enough at this point. I yelled loudly into my dark room, “Knock it off tonight! I want to sleep!” And it stopped! Just like that. Never heard another tapping or scratching sound again.

   "message": "A series of experiences:\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve seen shadows and heard creaking, closing doors, misplaced items, and other unexplainable things throughout my childhood home. I’ve ask always watched horror movies and scared myself by reading creepypastas; which means I had several different escape roots planned out depending on where the serial killer that was obviously going to come for me tried to get in. One day when I was in high school, I was home alone after school, sitting in the living room watching TV. From the mud room that connected the living room to the garage, I heard a loud bang like someone smashing their fist against the door connecting the garage and mud room. Ran up to the kitchen with my phone, grabbed a knife, and peaked over the counter out the window towards the front of the house. No one is outside, no cars, and the garage door was still closed meaning no one got into the garage, no wind slammed the door. I eventually talked myself out of the whole serial killer thing, but I haven’t been able to explain it and it hasn’t happened again.\n\nA different night, my parents were gone when I went to sleep. I wake up to knocking on my bedroom door - my parents wouldn’t have knocked to check in on me sleeping. Without access to a weapon, I froze, because obviously THIS time it’s gonna be the serial killer, and just laid there for 10 minutes. Never heard any footsteps. Nothing. Got up and went to my parents room, they were both fast asleep. So it’s not even like they had just come home when I heard the knocking.\n\nA different day, I set a water bottle on the kitchen counter and continued walking towards the hallway. A couple seconds later, I hear the bottle fall. But when I get back into the kitchen, the bottle is across the room. Yet another day, I was home alone in the living room when I heard a sneeze from back towards the bedrooms. My first instinct was to say “bless you”. My second thought was “didn’t my boyfriend leave 30 minutes ago?”\n\nDuring college, I came home for a break. I had to sleep in a loft bed, and I brought my sisters dog up with me because she liked to cuddle. I was woken up by both the feeling and sound of someone climbing up the ladder - which I was very acquainted with at that time. I could feel my sisters dog against my leg laying between me and the edge, when I felt something pet down the blanket like they were petting the dog. I must have moved, because the dog realized I was awake and immediately turned around to jump onto my chest with her ears down, shaking.\n\nThe intensity of events has toned down quite a bit. But for a stretch of time, something wanted to make itself known",

So I go out, sweating bullets, and I happen to be able to see the front porch outside that door from inside, so I POP on the lights!  Nothing is there.  The front yard, drive way, and yard are empty.  So I close the blinds, go back to the door and turn the lights off.  Maybe a half second later I can hear this sound, like someone was dragging their nails individually down the little cross hatching of a screen door.  A quick \\*tickticktickticktick\\*.  But no one was there, and there is just no way I missed it or they ran up that fast.  So I immediately put my back against the door and just said loudly \"I'm sorry Dad I wont do it again!\" and the sound immediately stopped.  And I will never, ever try that shit again.",

I never worked the site before but hey, overtime, I accepted... It was one of my dad's old sites. So it is about 0200, I am doing a round, I enter one of the buildings and I think I see someone moving up ahead. It is 0200 and the building is locked, there should not be anyone in there, I quietly close the door behind me and creep up for a closer look.

So it hits me that it is my dad, I'm standing there watching him, he is apparently doing a round of the building I am patrolling. So I watch him, he looks directly at me as if he could see me, he looks at me for about 30 seconds or so, he then turns the corner. I run to catch up with him but he was gone.

I don't know if it was a ghost, if I was hallucinating because it was one of his old posts and I was emotional, or if maybe some how time loops exist and I actually saw him working the site in the past.

I grew up in New England so these are in order of when they happened.\n\n— The house I grew up in was super haunted - my bed would shake, full-bodied apparitions, boots going up the stairs and out the window next to my bedroom, the desk chair spinning on its own when I was the only one home, a gravestone in the basement, etc.\n\n— My aunt was a preschool teacher at The Conjuring house in the early 2000s when I was about 8. I walked in the front door and out the back to the “playground” and refused to go back inside. \n\n— I had encountered something traumatic in my everyday life that I was dealing with mentally and I used to go ghost hunting regularly. I went with my mom and my aunt and we were sitting atop a mausoleum that looked like an old Greek ruin in the middle of this small cemetery in the center of a city (very oddly placed, in hindsight) and my spirit box said, “Blow your brains out!” in a really taunting voice - at the same time my mom heard, “why don’t you just shoot yourself already?” We left, our post, headed for the car and I saged the crap out of us all before we got in and drove away. That same night, we went to another (older) graveyard and I refused to get out of the car. I ended up blacking out and came-to at a stoplight about 12 minutes later.\n\n— I went ghost hunting in an old graveyard and blacked out and came-to in a spot that someone close to me had done a ritual in and I was staring at the treetops. \n\n— I work overnight in psych and I’ve had a little kid talk to me multiple times, a hand come out of a doorway of an empty patient room (I just shut the door) and last night we spent about 6 hours talking about this stuff and a patient directly next to our nursing station started talking in their sleep and we saw shadows in their room walking around.",

The awake ones probably startle me more, but they're few and far between and have been harmless. \n\nI don't often have the vivid dreams, but when I do, I wake up with messages. One night, I dreamt my best friend's mom came to visit me and asked me to take care of her daughter (my best friend). Made me promise. When I woke up that morning, I learned that she died from cancer. \n\nThe encounter that scared me was when I was staying over at my husband's house for the first time. I had a very vivid dream about a woman in posh Victorian clothes who rode a stage coach. I had a number of children around me that I didn't recognize, but I somehow instinctively knew she was there to do them harm, so I hid them in a special spot in a tunnel. (No idea which one or where we were.) She rode up to me, got out of the carriage, and demanded I give her the children or else she'd come after me. I told her that I'd stand in her way forever and that she could never have the children or hurt anyone else. She pulled a gun and went to shoot me, but my husband woke me up before she struck me. Her words to me as I was waking up were, \"I'll get those kids. You won't stop me forever.\"\n\nI didn't want my husband to think I was some weirdo (it was the beginning of our relationship), so I didn't say anything about it. But I started connecting some dots: his roommate (his BFF) was a single mom with multiple kids, and it turned out to be the same number of kids I was protecting. And while watching \"ghost adventures\" my husband told me that there's a \"lady in white\" who wears a fancy dress who he's seen in the hallway late at night. His BFF has seen her too.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very upset with that dream. And subsequently was very happy that everyone moved away from that house.",

We were maybe 20 or 21 at the time. \n\nWell, after one party, people started going to sleep wherever they could find space, and I picked the only open spot I could find, this old couch in that basement. I wake up after just a few hours, must have been 4 or 5am, and I hear a guy and girl whispering and giggling in that partially built next room. It sounded like someone who was at the party, so I got up to ask them to be quiet, and as soon as I got near that doorway, it stopped. Weird. But I thought maybe I was hearing people still partying upstairs, and it just sounded like whispering through the floor, no biggie. It didn't start back up, so I decided to ignore it and try to go back to sleep. \n\nI laid back down. That bright light was shining in my face, and I wasn't sure how to turn it off, so I closed my eyes and just tried to fall asleep anyways. While I'm laying on the couch with my eyes closed, I saw a shadow move across my eyelids, as if something moved between me and that light. \n\nSo at this point I sit bolt upright, and said \"nope, nope, nope, nope\" over and over again as I started walking towards the stairs. The cement floor was a bit uneven, so I'd hear a scuffing noise with some of my foot steps, but I'd hear it even when my shoe didn't scrape the floor. I stopped at the bottom of the stairs and listened, and those shuffling footsteps kept going, so I sprinted up the stairs and paused one more time at the top and looked back and saw... nothing. I don't know, I expected to see someone. I waited maybe 10 seconds, listening out, and finally I hear what sounds like a single footfall on wood and creak of that bottom stair. I shut the door behind me and backed away watching it, but nothing ever came through. \n\nI'm frantically trying to find one of my friends who rented the place without waking anyone up, and I find the roommate on an air mattress, in the living room, which is weird but whatever. I start shaking her, and I go \"C... C, wake up. Your basement is haunted!\" She just looks at me like I'm an idiot and says, \"Duh. We told everyone not to sleep down there.\" And I just went, \"Oh. So can I crash on the corner of the air mattress?\" And she said I could. \n\nSo the next day, I get all of the ghost stories from them about this house. Apparently, the main floor was haunted too, and the basement was just the worst spot for it.",

It was a skeleton crew and I was often alone. So I thought. I worked there three years and had keys to the shop very early on, many times the only one in the building at 3 a.m. running or setting up jobs.  \n\n\nI would be working and turn around to set the Turret Press to specs on the request order and turn back around to find my request order gone. I would look high and low for this paper at first in the thought that maybe there was a slight breeze or I created one when I turned .... I would have to work around this and move on to something else. It would sometime later return, very near where it had been. This, I assure you, was not a fatigue issue. I was not the only one things like this happened to.  \n\n\nIt did not happen often, but anything like that happening at all is once to many. By the time I settled upon the declarations of ghost, it had happened a third time in a year. The first time was about six month's in to my employment. There were other things like that, but it was the most frustrating, more mischievous than malicious. We all worked with that guy, you know what I mean.",

When I'm walking down the marsh walk I can almost hear whispers speaking to me through the reeds blowing in the breeze. Little words here and there that don't really mean much, and I have to strain to listen, but on occasion it's clear as day.
