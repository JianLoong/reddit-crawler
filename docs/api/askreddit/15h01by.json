   "message": "Fallout 4.  \nWait! Hear me out before downvoting!  \n\n\nFallout 4 seems to have lost the deep and intricate exploration of human survival that characterized the first two titles in the series. In Fallout 1 and 2, players were immersed in a post-apocalyptic world where human communities creatively and intelligently organized themselves to tackle the challenges of the new world.  \nIn the transition to Fallout 4 (and also 3 of course), much of this complexity appears to have been lost. The plot contains inconsistencies that undermine the coherence and depth of the game world. Characters that appear randomly, without adequate explanation of how they managed to survive, contribute to a sense of incoherence and superficiality in the setting.  \nOne of the emerging aspects is the transformation of some characters into mere caricatures, rather than complex and multifaceted figures. \nWhile encounters with mutants and radioactive creatures can be exciting and rewarding, it seems that the focus has shifted towards action at the expense of reflection on human survival.",
