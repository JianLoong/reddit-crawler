I live in a city 1.5 hours away. \n\nIf you're the type of personal who can get dirty, do ambiguous hours, learn quickly, don't sweat the small stuff, and be unphased by weather- the world is yours cause you're a rare breed at a time of tremendous change. The economy has basically pushed me towards this realization during the first 10 years of my career and it's helped that I've learned I like doing hard shit with my hands.
