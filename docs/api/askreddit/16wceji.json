   "message": "My parents were killed in a car accident on Christmas Day when I was young. I survived, obvs, but I can clearly remember the sound of everything settling afterward, and the steady drip drip of my mother bleeding out and watching the blood pool grow. I heard my dad take his last breath while mom died in surgery. \n\nI also watched the first people to stop and help riffle through our belongings, taking the rings off Mom's fingers, taking Dad's watch, and going through their wallets and removing cash/credit cards. While I was laying injured in the back seat they just winked at me, seriously they winked, and kept on stealing the belongings of a dead man and his dying wife in front of their child. \n\nThen they left us there.  It was a few more minutes before someone else came upon the accident and jumped into action and got first responders rolling, and got me out and sat trying to comfort me while I was injured and in shock.\n\nThanks to a lot of miscommunication (pre-digital age) in spite of a large family,  I ended up in the custody of the state and lost in the system until the age of 18. This was before they gave assistance and support to foster kids, so the day I turned 18, they literally opened the door to exit hell, and adios, you're on your own.\n\nYup, ruined my childhood, Christmas and my life all in one drunk driver.  Who lived.",

I always felt like I did something wrong, like it was something that eventually after taking lots of meds I could eventually become better. While I won't discount the drugs completely, for me it probably was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me. Years and years of depression which was followed by \"well let's put him on more drugs to counteract the drugs we are giving.\" Which just exasperated the issues. By the time I was old enough to realize this wasn't helping and articulate to my parents this they had mostly drank the kool-aid. Thank goodness my mom respected my opinion enough that after many years of telling her I hated it, she let me stop taking it. I can't possibly imagine my life continuing had I continued to take these mind altering drugs. Just like any drug, they have different effects on varying humans and again it's not that I'm completely against them, but for myself I am definitely against them. They did nothing for me except cause extreme depression and anxiety, and I've been through all the various adhd medications all of them in their own way would cause issues. While I won't say I'm perfect now by anymeans, understanding the difference in my brain chemistry versus \"a normal\" one was what really has made the biggest difference. As while I can't control it, I am aware of my short comings and if I remind myself of that to an extent I can control it. \n\n4chan... discovered when I was like 12.
