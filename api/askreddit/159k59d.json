We had an armed police officer on the tour bus (Road Scholar, and nothing against them, they are a great company to travel with), a police escort everywhere, bomb dogs and a guy with a mirror looking under the bus for bombs. Cairo is dirty, littered and the poverty is staggering. The food was meh at best as we could not travel outside the hotel or tour path to eat. It was blisteringly hot. The camel guys at the Pyramids were mean to all of the women and the animals, with children working there as well. The Egyptian Museum was a disgrace to the county. Poorly organized, bad labels, no security, priceless textiles, parchments, leather, etc jumbled in cases exposed to the air, heat, hands. No AC. The only things well cared for and secured were Tutankhamen's artifacts. It's a spectacular resource and collection and so badly cared for with no curation. The new one just opened, I sure hope it's better. Once you've seen one temple, one hieroglyphic, you've truly seen them all. It's all about tourist $ and the street vendors were RELENTLESS and scary. Even on a nice open boat ride down the Nile, kids paddled up to the boat on wooden doors, selling cheap crap or just begging. Never again.",

No.  Doesn't mean I'm not curious as to how they really live, what they do on a day to day basis, what kind of food they eat, see the architecture of Pyongyang, etc.  I'd love to be able to visit Russia one day without worrying about being persecuted by the government just for being an American.  I have every intention on making it to China at least once in my life (beyond Hong Kong).  In a magical world I would visit every country at least once, unfortunately that's not reality. \n\nNot sure where all this fear for Mexico is coming from though.  I've been there multiple times to different cities and it's a beautiful country with amazing food and people.  Is it dangerous?  Yes.  So is Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, hell, even Chico, California is dangerous nowadays.
