 "selftext": "I’m going to Mt. Buller this weekend, staying at an AirBnb with friends. \n\nI’m not interested in skiing, so was planning on doing some day hikes in the area. My first one is Mt. Buller to Craig’s Hut loop. \n\nAny experiences doing this trail in winter? Looking at the forecast it seems like there’s hardly any snow. Would I still need snowshoes and/or crampons?\n\nAny advice welcome.",

   "message": "The forecast is for rain at around freezing point this weekend. How good is your protection against almost freezing rain? And how is your experience with breakable crust from cycles of freezing, defrosting, and refreezing. Keep in mind that a surprise blizzard is always possible when you're high up. Personally, I'd head to a lower altitude for your walking in the interests of safety, especially given that I know someone who froze to death pursuing adventures in the Victorian mountains in winter.",

If you insist upon going you need a PRB and you need to make sure you notify Parks Victoria and as many other people as you can your anticipated arrival times so search parties can be sent out as appropriate.",
