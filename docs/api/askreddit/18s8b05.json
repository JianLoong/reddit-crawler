It's bright red and grainy. It's kind of like drinking a punch to the throat. But, I will say, whenever I feel myself getting sick, they make it for me and I'm better the next day. I have no idea what it is but they call it \"Wakanda Drink\" because they say it makes you strong like The Black Panther. \n\nI love the people I work with.",
