   "message": "To summarize my points below: Your 30s is when you are really in the thick of \"adulting\". It's easy to loose focus on what is really important to you among all the demands and responsibilities.\n\nNot Fostering Friendships: As you enter your 30s, maintaining and nurturing friendships becomes more challenging. It's a time when connections can fade, and forming new ones becomes harder. It's very important to invest effort in the friendships you currently have. **Edit:** A few people have commented about what to do when people don't reciprocate? My advise - keep trying! Everyone is under water in their 30's, they likely won't be able to make every attempt at outreach you make. But over time as things become less hectic they will remember you kept trying (without guilt) and will appreciate it and come back to you. But toxic people, yeah cut those out!\n\nNot Nurturing Your Romantic Relationship: Responsibilities increase in your 30s like careers, parenthood, and caregiving for aging parents. It's common for the most crucial relationship – your romantic partnership – to be inadvertently neglected. Avoid taking your partner for granted, assuming they'll always be around, or treating them as an outlet for your worst moments.\n\nNot Preserving Your Identity: Similar to the previous points, your 30s come with a whirlwind of conflicting priorities that can lead you to lose touch with your identity. It's easy to forget what truly brings you joy and satisfaction. Maintain a hobby that gives your life purpose and regularly reflect on whether your job still fulfills your needs in terms of purpose, financial stability, and overall satisfaction.\n\n\\-",

It is with you all the time and demands fulfillment.' \n\nA significant portion of who we truly are, what we like, what we are capable of, and the reasons we do the things we do, persist within a realm we don't actively understand or have access to. \n\nTo become our true selves, we need introspection to learn about the aspects of our being that we are unaware of, dislike or hide. \n\nThere's more in this [Free Newsletter](https://feresh.substack.com/p/introspection-become-your-true-self) about what's in the subconscious and how to learn about our inner world.",
