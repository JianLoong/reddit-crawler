Any doubt, any bit of uncertainty and I'd advise against it. I find that people are sometimes a bit more on the \"Let's just do it\" side because they think of it as easily reversible. It should be thought of as permanent.  \n\n\nI'm thinking, if you are 25, you've been with your girlfriend for 8 years, you live together, you've been working since you were 19, you are completely settled and you are adamant about never wanting kids, I think you can make that decision despite being young.  \n\n\nBut I'm thinking if you are 25, you've just come out of uni, your love life has been turbulent and unstable and right now you feel like you never want kids, I feel like maybe it would be better to wrap it up for a while and reassess how you feel about it.  \n\n\nThings might change. Your life is in full change and you've probably been in a position where you couldn't fathom having kids. Maybe your views change when you are settled more, when you have more money and luxury at disposal, when you meet that special woman. Or maybe they won't. But if they didn't change during all of that change in your life, I think you can make that decision and there will be very, very little chance you're ever gonna regret it.  \n\n\nI'm 27 right now, I went through long education so my situation would be closer to the latter. And I think if I felt like I never wanted to have kids, I wouldn't be able to be 100% certain at that point in my life, so I'd go for less invasive means of protection.

   "message": "My husband had his at 28 after our family was complete. The surgeon was fine with it. He asked us what would happen if God forbid something should happen to one of our children and we both said that while we understood that that was a scenario that we supposed would be very instinctual to want another baby to fill the void, we knew we couldn't \"replace\" the same child that's lost so would sadly have to cope with the loss. He was happy with that answer.\n\nA friend of mine has always been adamant that he never wants children and had a vasectomy in his mid 20s. He's about 38 now and he has zero regrets at all. He just knew 100% that he had no desire to be a father and took the right measure to prevent it happening.\n\nSo is 25 too young to make a drastic decision? I'd say yes, it's very young but there are so many variables that each case is so individual. Just don't act in haste, and consider freezing sperm if you have any doubts about it but do it anyway. Only go into it with the mindset that it is permanent sterilisation because reversal is not always possible. Good  luck with it all whatever you decide.",

Then maybe it's an OK idea. Single and no real idea of who you might end up with where? Then I'd wait a decade - your opinions might well change if your circumstances do. My current thoughts on where I want my life to go are not remotely the same as when I was your age, and I don't presume to know how I'll feel another ten years from now.",
