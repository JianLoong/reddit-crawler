Every single time after trying the door and finding it locked and therefore occupied, they would then knock on the door. For three years I wondered what this individual hoped to accomplish by knocking on a locked single occupancy restroom door.  Did they think we would become pooping buddies? I never got to ask them because those knocks were the only interactions we ever had.",
