   "message": "In Edward Scissorhands, the version shown to critics and reviewers contained a scene that got cut from the final theatrical version. The scene was during the opening when the grandmother starts telling her story to the little girl. Essentially, it made it clear that everything we are seeing in Edward‚Äôs story is not as it actually occurred, but rather we‚Äôre peering inside the little girl‚Äôs imagination, seeing how she‚Äôs interpreting what her grandmother is telling her. This brings whole new meaning to things like the way the houses are painted, how all the dads leave for work at exactly the same time, and the quirkiness of how everyone behaves. Once you know that this scene exists, you see the movie in a very different way. Much of what we think of a ‚ÄúTim Burton weirdness‚Äù is actually childlike imagination once you know.  \n  \nSo, go watch it again. It‚Äôs not a whole new movie, but it feels and comes across in a whole new way.",

   "message": "Forgetting Sarah Marshall\n\nJason Segal was cut from his part in Undeclared(the unofficial sequel to Freaks \u0026amp; Geeks) so Apatow and Segal made up a new role for him to play without being paid. Segal had just been dumped by Linda Cardellini(the being dumped while naked scene is based directly from that break-up)and wasn't getting any work, while his closest friends from Freaks and Geeks were blowing up. Apatow told him to make his own work, write and produce his own project if he wanted to star in things. So the guy started writing what would eventually become the Muppet movie- except all his friends were like 'no not like that.' Meanwhile on set of Undeclared he had become good friends with Charlie Hunnam and proceeded to write the script with him in mind for Aldous Snow. Fast forward, Hunham dropped out, Segals unusable script for Muppets turned into his Dracula musical(using Jim Henson Studious puppets) and How I met your Mother was a hit. All of this, led to him writing and starring in the highest grossing Muppets movie ever, which re-ignited the Muppets for new movies and shows after. Also without Forgetting Sarah Marshall we would never have been given the hidden gem that is I Love You Man and more importantly Paul Rudd giving us the line 'Totes Ma Goats'. Most people have no idea that was just a one off line thrown out there by Rudd or that is where that came from. Plus so much else.",
