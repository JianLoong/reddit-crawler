Tolkien wrote him as a satanic evil with no goodness whatsoever other than a lingering living memory in some ancient beings of a time when he was not yet so evil.\n\nI usually identify with villains at least a little, but Sauron is utterly unlikeable and completely horrible. So too are his minions and his ruined land of Mordor.",
