It sucks. The nerdy topic isn’t the attractive thing in and of itself-it is the openness and vulnerability. Like you are so comfortable you can be yourself with your niche things you love. Vulnerability is when you’re most open to attack, and it fully makes sense why people have learned to not put themselves out there like that. But, I still love it when it happens.",

And that helped because I would have to stop overthinking/obsessing and actually think about what he asked. Always calmed me down. And then if we were walking, he would insist I walk on the inner corner rather than on the side of the road (chivalry) I kid you not he went from a no one to the only one I was interested in! \n\nAlso, he never made me feel dumb if I didn’t know about something, so I could always ask him anything without feeling anxious. \n\nStill the Sexiest Man I’ve Ever Met.",

The sound she made and the look she gave me is still in my head lol.\n\nAfterwards she brought it up and said it was incredibly sexy how I could just handle and move her around so easily with so little effort.",
