   "message": "Question ... Is anyone using chatGPT as a general assistant but using it verbally through iOS ?\n\nThe use case ... I have a dog that we got during covid, and to my surprise he needs a lot more exercise than the internet suggested.   That means he's happiest with 1.5 - 2 hrs of walking a day ... Which is a lot more than I was prepared to give up when we got him.\n\nI'm looking at making better use of that time when it is during work hours (like lunch) and I've stumbled across its  good workflow to record some of my ideas verbally via the iPhone ... But when I do that my notes tend to ramble and not be well constructed.\n\n.... BUT when you feed those to chatGPT it almost always does a great job of cleaning the language up, providing a good summary and ideas of how to improve.  I get back to work with some good docs, emails and Todo lists that I'm ready to go with.   It's awkard though, I almost always am fumbling with my phone, and I think incould smooth it out with automation and get a better walk in.\n\nSo ... I'm looking for a good note taking flow using my iPhone , capturing the notes, proofreading them with chatgpt, and then taking that note either as an email or markdown.\n\nI'm using drafts pro, have a chatgpt subscription, so that is one system.  It needs a lot of work though to smooth it out ...,so thought I would ask if anyone else has a walking the dog workflow with iOS, with chatgpt running interference for quality control and sharing.",

   "message": "Asked chat gpt how to remove crayons from nose to reverse the lobotomization process and this is what I get.\n\nLSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) was first synthesized November 16, 1938. Through the genius research of the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman. Sandoz Laboratories were working on the development of a synthetic or semi-synthetic compound to improve, respiration and circulation. During the 25th derivative test of iodine, a strange new compound was discovered. The compound was thought to be inert (having no effect, or inherent use) until one faithful day, Albert Hoffman happened to not be properly followed safety procedures for handling unknown compounds. This lead to an unintended consumption of the unknown compound. While riding home from work on bicycle Albert Hoffman noticed slight auditory, and visual distortions. The discovery of auditory, and visual distortions lead researchers to begin animal testing. Eventually this compound was criminalized, due to the claims of some stating LSD(Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)is nothing more than addictive compound, having no medicinal value. Scientists later debunked this claim through conducting further research. Untapped medicinal benefits are now believed to be contained in LSD(Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) along with similar compounds (Psilocybin,DMT,Ketamine) These compounds have been shown as an effective treatment for the underlying effects of PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Data also states hallucinogens to be  effective treating patients diagnosed with anxiety, and depression disorders. As of today scientific institutions continue their research into the medical benefits of the relatively unexplored field that is Psychedelic research. As laws continue to change around the world research into this nearly unexplored field is becoming more readily accessible. Studies have show there to be no long term side effects observable in patients who participated in psychedelic research. Psychedelic medicine is only to be used in a controlled environment with the observation of medical professionals. When used for the medicinal benefits these compounds will better the lives of many struggling individuals around the world. With this being said Psychedelic compounds are medicine to be treated with the utmost respect such as any medicine prescription or over the counter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9xsygodbgdb1.jpeg?width=540\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=4ece1a34ae4612dfd10c60857820f84bafd17402\n\nPs Shrek is Love Shrek is Life stay happy never give up üòä",

I see the potential for massive productivity gains in this wave of OpenAI. Including but not limited to the release of a large amount of productivity (for example, the original team task of 100 people may now only need 10 people to operate AI), whether this can be considered as an important trigger for changing production relations.

The current digital climate has provided us with access to AI-powered chatbots, like ChatGPT. However, most Australian universities have implemented updated guidelines on how AI can (or typically cannot) be used during assessments. We would like to gather more information **directly** from university students.\n\nClick below to contribute your valuable response to our survey and help shape our understanding of student needs, AI use, and assessments. Your participation is and will remain **anonymous** and is expected to take **10-15 minutes**. \n\n**Link:** [https://questionpro.com.au/t/ARnKPZRtvk](https://questionpro.com.au/t/ARnKPZRtvk)\n\n*Note: Australian university students only.

I was wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar problem and if there are any potential solutions.\n\nDuring my recent testing, I asked ChatGPT to assist me in refactoring some code I've been working on. The code in question consists of around 112 lines. Initially, ChatGPT successfully generated 26 lines of code based on my instructions. However, when I requested it to continue writing and complete the remaining lines, it unexpectedly restarted from the beginning and stopped abruptly at 28 lines.\n\nInterestingly, when I assigned ChatGPT with other tasks, it performed flawlessly without any hiccups. So, I'm particularly curious to know if this code writing issue is specific to my experience or if others have encountered it as well.\n\nIf any of you have faced a similar situation or have any insights into what might be causing this behavior, I'd greatly appreciate your input. It would be helpful to understand if there's a workaround or if there are any tips to improve the code writing performance.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from the community!

They made money doing this with ads, native ads, and/or donations. Monetization also occurs through paywalls or selling the information such as a book. ChatGPT allows users to bypass the ads and paywalls to access the information directly. This will likely lead to information creators to not being able to afford to create this information unless they are receiving money from donation sources (like universities or private research funding). Some creators will adapt by only pumping out information that directly directs people to a paid product. Like if someone is writing about plumbing, they will no longer write general plumbing articles unless everything directly ties to including SharkBite fittings. \n\nSo what is a good sustainable model for the sharing of money through this new system of asking Chatgpt how to fix a new toilet flush mechanism and getting good information.
