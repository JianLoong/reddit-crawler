 "title": "AITAH for not telling my boyfriend that I was a virgin before we had sex?",
 "selftext": "I (22F) started dating my boyfriend (25M) about two months ago. However, we had sex before we started dating, about a month before that. We met eachother through tinder, and I was looking for something casual and definitely not a relationship. When we first met; I was a virgin in the sense that I had never had sex with anyone. However, I had been used to my sexuality and penetration with sex toys for a while before hand, so I knew that having sex with him wouldn’t hurt. For other reasons that I won’t get into cause this post will be unnecessarily long, my virginity is not a huge deal to me, I’m not an emotionally attached person, I knew I loved sex even before I actually did it, and I just needed someone to do it with the first time to get it over with. And I never thought he would find out, I thought it would be a one night stand, but it turned into much more. But yesterday he finally asked me who I lost my virginity to, and I confessed that it was him. He was hurt understandably, he and I both value communication and honesty, but when I tried to explain that that night we were together for the first time didn’t hurt me, and that I had lost my “innocence” years ago, he shut me down. He hasn’t spoken to me since last night, and I need some help understanding how he feels, since it can be hard for me to understand others feelings and emotions without them directly telling me. I also feel like I never lied, just kept it a secret, since we never talked about if either of us was a virgin, we both just assumed.",
