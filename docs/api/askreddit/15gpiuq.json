You can eat whatever you want, but it needs to reflect what you *really, really want.* Start writing down what you eat, you won‚Äôt always need or want to do this and that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs a periodic tool to keep you honest. Also make friends with the spice aisle. \n\nExercise: Find movement you don‚Äôt hate and stick with it no matter how slow or small the time investment. I did exactly one down dog to up dog today, do I count it as my yoga for the day? Yes, yes I do, the same as the class I take on Monday nights. Hobbies can be exercise too (gardening, roller skating, wood/metal working, etc). It all counts. You don‚Äôt have to be a gym rat, as the slogan says, ‚Äújust do it.‚Äù Look into functional fitness and functional movements. At the very least you want to be able to physically haul yourself up and out of most situations, ie. a fall. Start there and see what interests develop. \n\nMental health: Unpack the baggage. You‚Äôre doing this for you not your demons. You‚Äôre going to backslide. The key is you need to build your resiliency. The scale is not the only measure of success ‚Äî and put those other metrics to use. Take measurements, track your mood, take note of how you feel and the fit of your clothes each day; those little things can be great reinforcements. Maybe the scale isn‚Äôt budging, but you‚Äôre feeling and sleeping well. That‚Äôs a win, and you need to keep rolling with it. Focus on tracking and improving your BP and cholesterol levels, too. This is a long game with no quick fixes (even surgery and medication require all this hard work and consideration). \n\nThe importance in the scale lies in the long game. You want to see a downward trend with normal peaks and valleys as you go through this journey. I once crabbed to my doctor that I was only losing ~6 pounds a year and she reminded me that it‚Äôs better to lose that 6 than gain it and to consider the cumulative affects. Most people gain the weight back within 5 years because they don‚Äôt unpack the emotional baggage around their bodies/food/exercise and they enact changes at an unsustainable rate. \n\nSource: I‚Äôve lost 75 pounds in 10 years.

Full discosure, I'm lean naturally, I just wanted to lose the weight I had gained\nduring a depression. I lost about 35lbs in maybe 5 or 6 months (180lbs \u0026gt; 145lbs)\n\nIntermittent fasting: I did 10:14 then later changed 8:16 when my body got more used to not eating all the time. Sticking to the fasting helped eliminate after dinner snacking and drinking which is where a lot of problems were in my diet. \n\nCalorie deficit: I was eating anywhere between 1300-1800 calories a day. I focused more on the weekly calories. That way if I splurged on a meal with friends it didn't make the day a \"fail\" day. I still had time to adjust my eating later in the week. \n\nExercise: I was working out for about 2-3hrs 4-6x a week. About 50% of that was cardio, 30% weights, 10% core, and 10% stretching.",

   "message": "Learning patience, simplifying the process, accepting I am human and making adjustments and plans that work for me.\n\nFirst, I simplified - I went straight Calories out \u0026gt; Calories in\n\nSecond - What worked for me was not NOT eating certain foods.  Meaning I didn't say I \"can't' have certain things.  That didn't work and I don't believe it works really well for most as it is more of a punishment.   I gave up diets, and work outs etc. I truly believe they are not sustainable - if I can't figure out how to do this without a special diet/fad foods/exercise regiments then I am not going to succeed.  So I focused on lifestyle changes, self control, portion control and mitigation.\n\nInstead of living off Soda all day - I have 1, small one, at dinner.   I like it, I look forward to it.I stopped leaving snacks in arms reach (like at my desk).   I have a candy dish with loose sweets (Andes mints, peanut butter cups etc. - the mini stuff, not full bars).  If I have a sweet fix I take 1, literally 1.   It satisfies the craving and I don't binge on it.  They are also kept in a cupboard (or the fridge during summer) so they are not in easy reach - much easier to not give in.\n\nI keep my breakfasts consistent.  1 of 3 things, I know the calories of each and I start the day with a known.\n\nLunches are simple.  Sandwiches,  soups etc. with a proper portion of chips or what not.\n\nDinners I cook just enough for dinner OR enough for a planned left over dinner.   Then portion control.  Rather than anticipate how much to eat to be full, I do reasonable servings/portions.  If I am still hungry I can go back - but usually I do not need to.\n\nFor activity I do things around the house, yard work, house work etc.  When I go out anywhere I purposely park as far away from the doors as I can to make me walk more. (Unless it is raining).   I make sure I get up from my desk at least once and hour and walk around the house, go downstairs, go outside, something to move.\n\nIs every day a success - nope, and it won't be - but I have stopped beating myself up over it and forgive (not excuse, never excuse) the bad days and get back to it.\n\nSo far it has stuck - 125lbs down last check.   Will every day be perfect, nope, will I ebb and flow - up and down - yup, will I plateau and have to adjust - yup, but as long as the movement is net down I am happy.  Is it easy - it is now that I have been doing it for a while - sweet stuff tastes TOO sweet most of the time,  If I come close to eating like I used to I feel ill/heavy/sluggish and I don't really think about food like I used to.\n\nThat is me though.\n\nDo what works for you - if it is similar, great if it is something else also great.  No single person has the magic diet.     The only thing I will say is constant and a given is Cal Out should be greater than Cal In - you will lose weight.\n\nIf you are looking because you want to lose weight - you got this, whatever method you chose - you got this.   It is hard, but you go this.",
