   "message": "Gambling from what I could tell.I was in rehab in the past in a group of people with various addictions.\n\nThe people who struggled most were the gambling addicts.\n\nI've gotten off different kinds of drugs, including opiods. Which were all relatively doable as they are very much chemical addictions. Meaning your body \"needs\" the drug after a certain time. But once you stop that usually  ends after a week. Not saying it's easy but once you're past the first week it gets a lot better. I saw non of that happen to the gambling addicts... as their addiction was fully ingrained in their mind. Obviously it's all about the dopamine but they were never dependant on foreign chemicals needing to go into their body.\n\nGambling also seemed like the worst for the people around them... They would steal and scam everyone they could get to... Friends, family.. Even coworkers. And they're good at it as their minds were not clouded by chems . So making plans was possible due to a certain clearity of mind it seems. It was actually heartbreaking to hear about sometimes.\n\nAfter that I think it's alcohol. Mainly because it's literally everywhere... there is no escape from it.\n\n\\-Edit for spelling",

Took about 2 weeks of that.\n\nAlcohol cessation gave me seizures but the DTs are only as bad as the volume/frequency you drank - it'll dictate the physical side effect fallout\n\nMeth was easy, just gotta make it through the first 72hrs-1week\n\nCoke/crack is about 48hours and then maybe a week of craving it \n\nBenzos, depending on the half life - I've tried over 15 different kinds - they weren't that bad to suddenly stop (don't do this, seizures are common)\n\nDissos, depending on the disso but like ketamine is kinda hard to get addicted to unless you're really going to town on it. Even then the withdrawals aren't as bad - something like 3-ho-pcp is a bit different though, daily use you're going to get some rebound effects but nothing terrible or life threatening\n\nMethadone - sucks for the first 48-96 hours but after that it's ok\n\nSuboxone - doses of 0.5mg every 48 hours was hard to stop, super high binding affinity made it sticky and bitch to get off of - worse than heroin, oxy, morphine, methadone IMO\n\nSSRIs/snris suck cause of the brain zaps but titrating the dose down makes a big difference \n\nSo to answer your question - the shittiest drugs to DT from are opioids/opiates - GABAs like alcohol and benzos, phenibut sucked too, then stims with longer half lives to shorter so meth to crack (depends on the roa but usually the half life dictates how bad DTs will be)\n\nDissos kinda suck to stop but it's something you can just grin and bear it through\n\nNicotine is harder as the moa is addictive vs psychedelics\n\nEdit* coming up on 5 years sober btw",
