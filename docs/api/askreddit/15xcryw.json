   "message": "How guys support other guys during times of mourning.\n\nYears ago, my best friend's mother passed away suddenly, unexpectedly, and entirely preventably, at an age far too young to die. I called him when I found out, talked with him for a bit, passed on my condolences, and told him to call if there was anything I could do for him.\n\nAbout a week and a half later, I invited him over to my house. I asked, \"How are you holding up?\", to which he responded, \"I'm hanging in there\" - both of which are guy-code-phrases, in which an entirely different question was being asked and answered.\n\nFor the next 12 hours, we hung out in my den and played through a series of his favourite video games. During this 12 hour span, not a single word was uttered regarding what had happened.\n\nAfter he went home, my then-girlfriend asked about how things went and was utterly flabbergasted when she found out that we had not talked about his mother at all. She got a bit miffed at me and accused me of not supporting my best friend in his time of need; I had to patiently explain to her that this *was* how guys supported each other. All of us know the drill, despite it never being taught. My job that day was not to try to prise feelings out of him that he was not inclined to share; my job was to provide an environment for him to kick back for the entirety of the day and forget about how shitty his life was at that moment. It was to provide a setting free of distractions and extraneous bullshit, doing an activity he liked, so he could enter a sort of zen meditative state and start to feel like the world was righting itself. And I'd expect him to do the same for me if the situations were reversed.\n\nAny woman I've ever talked to about this has been confused, if not outright offended, by this state of affairs, but the simple fact is that (most) guys grieve differently than (most) girls do and we support each other accordingly.",
