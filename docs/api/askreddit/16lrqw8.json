It's utterly pointless, doesn't even get you high...well in the beginning you get a head rush for like 30 seconds to a minute but it quickly stops being a thing as the tolerance increases. But it's a bitch to kick once you do get addicted. You just don't know how to be without it anymore.\n\nI remember my grandma making me promise to never start smoking. I promised but I was in my mid-teens back then and smoking seemed cool (e-cigs/vapes were still like 10 years ahead). Well, it all started with me occasionally bumming a cigarette from the \"cool kids\", eventually asking the older kids to buy me a pack and I ended up a full time smoker for almost 10 years. Like during the ages 16-26 I smoked.\n\nNowadays I use nicotine pouches for harm reduction but damn, it's a totally pointless addiction to have. I basically use it just to curb the craving. Doesn't make me feel \"good\" or alter my mind in any way, like weed or alcohol would..",
