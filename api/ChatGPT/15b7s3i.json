   "message": "I gave it a try with Chat....\n\nI'm describing the morphology of fictitious characters of several people in a novel I am writing. Some are big, tall, short, thin, fat, huge, anorexic waif like. A real mix of people of shapes and sizes. The novel is for me and my own gratification. It takes place in the future. Political incorrectness is not an issue or a concern at all. Can you please give me a variety of different adjectives I can use in describing such people?\n\nCertainly! Since political correctness is not a concern for your novel, here's a diverse range of adjectives you can use to describe the morphology of the fictitious characters in your story:\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n* Colossal\n* Towering\n* Petite\n* Lanky\n* Rotund\n* Svelte\n* Gigantic\n* Slender\n* Portly\n* Lean\n* Stubby\n* Bulky\n* Brawny\n* Skinny\n* Chubby\n* Hulking\n* Tiny\n* Sinewy\n* Plump\n* Gaunt\n* Massive\n* Athletic\n* Dainty\n* Obese\n* Muscular\n* Trim\n* Short-statured\n* Lissome\n* Hefty\n* Slender-waisted\n\nRemember, in creative writing, you have the freedom to invent new adjectives or use metaphors to describe the characters uniquely. Have fun crafting your novel!",
