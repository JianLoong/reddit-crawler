 "selftext": "So we’ve been married for 30+ years 3 adult children. We have remodeled and flipped houses, very hands on being my previous profession in interior design and my husbands experience in construction ( he’s a developer) hands on meaning I literally ripped out and finished what was replaced including painting the entire exterior and interior of our homes. So I became a SAHM as we both agreed to before the multiple home construction projects began and multiple kids. I have devoted my time to guiding our kids thru private school apps (it’s ridiculously stressful for all) and providing all guidance and support for our kids. Kids now growen and out of the house and I am now being told “he makes all the money so I don’t have a say in how he spends” nothing new gone on for years! My current concern is nearing retirement and he seems completely oblivious. When I mentioned that even though I don’t hav a paycheck my fees for all I have done to further our family are significant had I presented a bill, he mocked me. He has a very stressful job, makes a lot of money but I’m tired of him rubbing in my face that he’s the one with the paycheck. AITAH for voicing concern about spending so close to retirement while reminds me I don’t make the money?",
