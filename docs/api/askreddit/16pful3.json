I once made ravioli from scratch as a project with my daughters (aged 7 and 9). \n\nFirst we minced the pork filling, sliced and fried onions, added herbs, and then cooked the mixture on the stove. We then made the pasta by hand, mixing flour and eggs until it became a paste and then rolling it out with a pasta machine until it was silky and smooth. \n\nI had a suitable mould so we rolled the pasta out, filled the tray with spoonfuls of the meat and then cooked the now-prepared ravioli in boiling salted water. In the meantime we had cooked some more onions and herbs from the garden and added 1kg of tomatoes from the vegetable plot. This we then sieved and reduced to make a thick tomato sauce.\n\nFinally we grated some parmesan, added the ravioli to the sauce and served the result to the rest of the family. Time taken: about 4 hours from start to finish, including the washing up. \n\nVerdict: really good, tasted just Heinz's best canned produce. \n\nNever again.",
