 "selftext": "I'm quite active throughout Melbourne and I've noticed an incredible amount of South Americans currently working in Melbourne, most of them from Columbia. I don't have an issue with this but I think I've spoken to about 20 waiters so far who have stated they're from Colombia and even out at bars im meeting so many south americas. Anyone know the reason for the influx?  \n\n\nEdit: Colombia",
