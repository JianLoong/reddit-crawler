Being around people who are (overly) unforgiving can be detrimental to one's mental health.\n\nWhat typically signals insecurity is when people aren't organically relating to others. Sales people are insecure in that they're probably insecure about not having more money, for example. So, basically any attempt at selling oneself is a sign of insecurity, which can include bragging and so on (\"I'm alpha, have a big dick, stronger than everyone, emotionally invulnerable, formidable in whatever, etc.\"). Also, top-down attempts at relating to others can signal insecurity because insecure people need to feel in control of others. Authoritarian types are some of the most insecure people. People who pride themselves on leadership (i.e. Alphas) are probably more authoritarian and so also probably insecure.",
