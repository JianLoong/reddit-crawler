   "message": "I've recently been exercising more to lose weight.\n\nLast week, I was walking, and turned down a block near my home. There were three children who had just gotten off the school bus for the afternoon.  Two little boys and a little girl... Maybe 9 or 10 years old.\n\nThe two little boy peeled off to their houses.  That left the little girl.  She was maybe 40 feet ahead of me or so.  \n\nShe's little and I'm 6'3 so I gradually gain on her.  It does not even occur to me that she might be worried as I walk regularly and I see lots of other kids on bikes, adult men and women walking, etc.  I live in a beautiful country club neighborhood with parks and ponds and the golf course and a community pool.  Again... It never even occurs to me that she feels she might need to worry about the 6'3, bearded, shirtless man power walking behind her.\n\nShe hears my footsteps, turns around, is visibly terrified and begins to walk like those Olympic speedwalkers.  A few seconds later she turns around again, and as she does I put my hands up, say \"You're okay... I'll walk over here\" and point to the other side of the road.  I hustle over there and make absolutely zero eye contact with her beyond that.  When I get to the end of the street to turn around, she's gone, so I assume she made  it home.\n\nI guess I'm glad she has the presence of mind to be aware of her surroundings and be as safe as she could be, but it's almost embarrassing.  I felt like a predator for a moment. \n\nSorry little girl.",
