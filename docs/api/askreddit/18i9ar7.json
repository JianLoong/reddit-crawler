A few of us happened to share a cab ride with him and his wife, and he proceeded to puke all over the front seat, and then puked several times more.  The taxi driver was understandably furious and threatened to call the police.  We all gave ¬£50 each to pay for the mess and cleanup (so ¬£150 total plus the cost of the ride), and essentially bribe the taxi driver.  His wife was crying from embarrassment but promised he'd pay us back.  He never did, but word got around to our boss who reimbursed us and he was never invited to any other office function.  Only reason he kept his job was he brought in a lot of sales.",

It was right down the block so I told him that he didn‚Äôt need to pay me but he insisted which made me a little cautious\n\nI drove to the house and he got out, walked up to the house, and then went around to the BACK of it which I definitely thought was weird. About 5 minutes later he came sprinting out with a backpack\n\nTurns out he was going through a nasty divorce and the wife kicked him out of their house last minute with threats so that her new man could move in. The guy had to break in to his own house to get an overnight pack with some clothes because he was flying across the country to stay with a friend. \n\nThen the ride after that I accidentally almost picked up a meth-ed up hooker so I tapped out for the night.",

I drove the guy out to the boonies, maybe 40 miles, and then waited in the driveway for a few hours. The curtains were drawn, but every now and then you could see shadows of people going back and forth. He came out and wanted to go back home. As we got into town, he rolled down the window and threw up. Nice.\n\n\\---\n\nThe dispatcher gives me an address to pick up. It's the city police. I pull up outside the cop shop, and there's an officer holding a very flexible man whom he pours into the back seat of the car, and hands me a note with the address of the guy's sister. I get to the sister's apartment building.  The guy pays, just handing over bills, telling me what they are, though they're not. There is a step or two to get to the door of the building, and it takes two hands to open the door, so I let go of the guy, get the door open, turn to grab the guy, and he's all four legs in the air, head down the steps. His sister came along and took over then.\n\n\\---\n\nA couple of us are sitting in the stand, one driver is reading a book in the first car in line. Now, the layout here is that were was a kind of tunnel though the building that exited onto the main street. And in the tunnel was the back door to a bar. We got a lot of trips from those drunks. Anyway, there we are and we hear the back door of the bar open (the band gets louder) and then a woman and a couple of men yakking away. Then we hear \"ooooh!\" and what sounds like a bongo drum. One tap. We all winced. The three head to the first car in line, and he calls in that he's going to the hospital emergency. Turns out she fell. But not just fell, she stepped back on the stairs out the back door of the bar and fell. Backwards. And the bongo drum was her head hitting the asphalt. And her head bounced about a foot. And then she wanted to bootleg a case of beer, but her friends convinced her to go to the hospital.\n\n\\--\n\nThere was the regular. We'd pick him up several times a week, and it was always normal. Then one night he called very late, like 2 or 3 AM. I'm up, so I go to his apartment building. He was always out right away, and this time he wasn't. I wait a bit, I beep the horn, but no show. So I grab the mike: \"Car 18m, he's a no.....oh... there he is...she is .... never mind\". Our guy comes out. Dressed in a lovely green evening gown. He gets in the back, and this was a guy who always sat in the front (that was ok back in the 1970s) and gives an address. He pays, then asks me to wait, he'll be right out. He's inside for a few minutes, comes out and wants to go home. And he pays again. I tell the dispatcher and the other driver, who tell me that I'm buying coffee! As I come out of Timmies, I hear the other driver \"uh... and there'll be a return on this\", meaning that the customer is going someplace, then coming back. The other driver comes in, looks at me and tells me \"I thought you were kidding!\"\n\n\\--\n\nAll this happend over about three or four months.",
