 "selftext": "Morning everybody! \n\nAs the title says, Iâ€™m looking to find a supplier of live ladybirds to encourage a population in my garden, I already have the basics to look after them, i.e. correct plants and flowers and even a place for them to nest, but I was hoping to buy some to help start it off! \n\nThere is a website based in Brisbane that Suppy live ladybirds. Unfortunately they are out of stock and I would prefer to support someone local  - also Iâ€™m not very patient woman and I would like them now ðŸ˜‚ \n\nThought someone might have an idea of where to go! \n\nThanks!",
