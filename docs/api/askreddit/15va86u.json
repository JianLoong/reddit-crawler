Every day was spent worrying and feeling guilty about her there alone. Every time the phone rang I felt it would be some bad news about her. She died alone May/2021. No more visits, hugs or kisses. Only two weeks later visitation began again. When I think of torture this was the worst I had experienced.",

Seeing your loved wife slowly degrading into a senseless zombie, losing her sanity and getting insane. Thinking about suicide but then thinking about your other kid who really needs you. Living in a zealot society which venerates autism as some kind of a better part of humanity despite the toll it brings to the entire family. Feeling afraid to express your thoughts about it openly because of getting hastily labelled as a scum. Erich Fromm once said that one's dignity has nothing to do with his/her societal use. I am perfectly OK with this thought. But how about one losing his own dignity in the name of the other's? One losing his well-being and sacrificing his and his family's life to meet society's highest expectations about humanity? Can you answer that, Fromm?",
