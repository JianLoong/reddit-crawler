 "selftext": "My parents are house poor, they have a huge car note from buying a luxury car. They also live in a massive house they cant afford. My dad has a good job making 100k a year but my mom works retail and barely makes anything and they can barely get by.  I told my parent's Don't buy us any christmas gifts. And also my brother'ss wife doesn't need anything either, She's got a closet full of LV. My sister heard me telling our mom not to buy us anything and she was like \" Speak for yourself. I still want a free people gift card.\" I was like \" Free people is high as hell. Mom and dad don't have free people money. stop being selfish. You're an adult buy it yourself.\"\n\nMy sister called me a bitch because she said it was none of my buisness what our parents bought her.  She told me to stay in my own lane\n\nbut my sister is an attorney. She can buy herself all the free people she wants. But my sister snapped at me because she said mom was already planning on giving her a $200 dollar free people gift card.\n\nI asked my sister does she feel guilty asking for christmas gifts knowing they are house poor. She was like \" uhh no because I literally never ask them for anything. \"\n\nMy sister was like \" Honestly you sound controlling and jealous as well. You can't tell mom and dad what to buy us or what not to buy us. You can only speak for yourself.\"",
