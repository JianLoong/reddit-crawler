But that seems snarky. I could say I'm washing the dishes. But that seems snarky. I could agree to \"Nothing?\" but then I look like I'm a lazy bum for doing \"Nothing\" at 10am on a Wednesday morning when, really, I'm doing dishes, laundry, bills, and planning how I'm going to get my school work done and in what order, and...and...\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't \"dislike\" this person. They are kind and generous and sweet. They probably meant nothing by their question. But this is why I dislike \"people\", because when I'm around them I feel this dissonance inside me. Before that person walked into the room I was happy and fine. When I lived on my own I was happy and fine for weeks on end. \n\n**Hell is other people -- Sartre**",

What a bunch of Bastards\" - IT Crowd\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI think there's lots of reasons to dislike people in general, and it's largely due to \"people\" being either willingly engaging or blissfully complicit with other people's bad behavior.\n\nI mean, anti-intellectualism is alive and well. People don't understand the environment, technology, psychology, politics, economics... almost every \"large scale idea\" is just outside of the public's comprehension, and the media, both entertainment and informative, has simply given up on educating people about significant issues. It's all noise appealing to people's self interests and profiteering anymore.\n\nI know it's \"a big ship\" and it takes a while to turn, but society is right fucked if it can't identify cancerous traits and excise them before they spread. Misinformation is a bigger problem now due to social media, but \"the problem with social media\" is people. The platform is only that, a way to distribute information, it's the people that use it who are the problem.\n\nHonestly, people are a little too keen on protecting friends and family instead of confrontation and abandonment. You should never harbor a rapist, or a child trafficker, or a flat earther, but people do! They make excuses and hold traditions, claiming that a handful of acceptable traits makes up for being a criminal or an insufferable idiot. People suffer \"the racist grandpa\" rather than confronting him and telling him they won't invite him to any more family events unless he changes.\n\nThat's what bad people need most, to be cut off from the support mechanisms that enable their terrible behavior. You can't change people who don't want to change, so you have to make them uncomfortable with their own toxicity by removing their enablers.\n\nIt's a feedback loop. Stupid people enable stupid people. And by the numbers, most people are kind of stupid. I think that's ample reason to be skeptical and distrusting of \"people\" in general until they prove themselves to be something above average.",

   "message": "What bothers me most of all, is what people are willing to buy into, and engage, and believe in, in the Internet era. It's essentially the war on truth, these days, \u0026amp; we live in an age of a vast \u0026amp; contradictory sandbox online. I've backed away from most Internet social arenas at this point, Reddit is my final refuge- it's the only social application that I bother to use anymore. I rarely even ask Google for much, anymore. It's not at all hard to sell ideas, beliefs and alleged facts to most people, these days, if you can deliver your message through an official broadcasting station or publishing house (bonus points applied, if you have a secondary schooling certificate backing you up). It's not a given that everyone will buy into whats on TV, just because it's on TV (of course) but overwhelmingly- many transformed and successfully brainwashed lazy thinkers won't question much, if they simply believe that someone else knows better than they do (usually because of a piece of paper that says \"Im a professional\"). It just kinda surprises me, that so many people can have such blind faith, all because Dr Asshole or Professor know-it-all or someone with some certificate says something to be true, or whatever. I for one don't trust a whole lot these days, and I really don't know what to believe anymore, either. I typically can't really engage other people, on a day to day basis, in-person, if they can look at the world around them and simply take it all at face-value. If a person tends to believe that the news is more or less telling them the truth, and that the Government more or less has their best interests at heart, the chances that we will ever see much eye-to-eye on things, are pretty slim. Anyone who believes that this insufferable meat dimension is all there is to life, are not my people. Tl;Dr : Come to my table with your most bizarre conspiracy theories, and alien chatter, cryptozoology to urban legends and talk of shape shifting reptilian overlords, or don't show up at all. I prefer to rub shoulders with people who think for themselves, and also question what they believe to be true (at all times), and most importantly- people who trust themselves, first, before they go ahead and trust anyone else. I often say \"you are the smartest person you will ever meet, but only if you think for yourself\" and usually- noone ever believes me when I say it. I tend to befriend people, who believe that it's possible, that I'm not wrong about that notion.",
