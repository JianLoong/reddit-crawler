He seemed only half-conscious, kept yelling random proclamations at the show, tried to play the keyboard tattoo on his arm like it was a real piano...and more. Then I saw an interview he gave about 3 years after that and, somehow, he was MUCH worse. It was clear this guy needed a major intervention if his life was going to get on track and continue. A real shame.",
