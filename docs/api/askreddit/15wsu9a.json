   "message": "\"I'm sure you did your best.\"\n\nIt's such a weird backhanded insult that most people don't even catch it.  Because for someone else to say you did your best, means they don't think you could have done any better.  It's saying the outcome is your best.\n\nKid fails a test.  \"I'm sure you did your best\"\n\nReally?  My best is failing?  \n\nKid makes a drawing, they're really proud of how it came out.  Someone says \"I'm sure you did your best.\"\n\nWhy isn't it just good?  This may be his best, but why are you so sure that he can't do any better?  \n\nThere's a world of difference from this phrase vs \"I'm sure you tried your best(/hardest)\" because that's a matter of effort and is complementing how they try.\n\nBut **did** your best is a low key insult when you think about it.  It sounds so nice until you think about what was said.",
