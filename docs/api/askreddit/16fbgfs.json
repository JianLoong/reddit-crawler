I feel [Nexpo's video](https://youtu.be/NU4MgeOb-cc?si=o2SJe-A7g3uDgWQd) on the situation gathers all the information nicely.\n\nFor those who don't know; Harry Horse was a game developer who lived with his wife Mandy in Scotland. Mandy fell ill with MS and her rapidly deteriorating health left her increasingly disabled and Harry was her primary carer. \nTwo friends were visiting the couple on the night of the incident, and this is where witness statements begin to contrast.\nHarry was apparently known for his mood swings and odd comments, especially on the night of the incident - he's reported to have said [paraphrased] \"it's a wonderful night for a killing.\" \nMandy begged for the two friends to stay, but they left.\nSaid friends claimed to have left a jacket behind, so a little while later they returned to the house.\nThe door was open.\nThe place was a gruesome, bloodied mess.\nTheir pets were slain. Mandy had been stabbed over thirty times, a broken knife left inside her. Harry had bled out from forty-seven wounds including mutilated genitals and slashed arms.\n\nThis was initially reported as a \"Romeo and Juliet\" suicide pact, and then a murder-suicide; Harry was said to have consumed a \"cocktail of drugs\" before brutally murdering his wife and pets before turning the knife on himself. \nBut Harry's autopsy reported a total absence of drugs.  From class As to benzos to paracetamol, there was nothing.\nThe door being open? The friends forgetting a jacket on the infamously cold Shetland Islands? Nobody having the slightest clue what happened? None of it adds up to me.\n\nI may have forgotten a lot of information and for that I'm very sorry. Honestly the more you find out, the more confusing it becomes.",
