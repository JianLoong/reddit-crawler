I also have recovered multiple items including postcards of the sanatorium people sell online without realizing where they're from. The arguably coolest piece in my collection though is a 1920s doctor's bag that I recently got, I'm hoping to eventually have enough pieces from the sanatorium itself to donate to my local museum that has an exhibit on this stuff!",

   "message": "Cum… always wanted to but didn’t start until about 2 months ago because I had my own freezer. I didn’t wanna end up like those guys with rotting cumjars in their smelly bedrooms, but I love cum, so I wanted to have a lot of it, so the only way was to save it up. I bet freeze-drying it would preserve it better and I could save up decades worth to make into one huge sploodgefest! I haven’t been able to salvage most of my blown loads because they got lost in the sheets with my gf or she wanted me to blow onto her body etc, and we’re not particularly horny people so we haven’t much, but it’s a start",
