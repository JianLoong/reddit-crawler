 "title": "AITAH for not sharing my wealth with my daughters?",
 "selftext": "Iâ€™m 74 and thanks to an stock inheritance I received from my father about 30 years ago I have amassed around a ten million dollar net worth with around eight million of that currently in the market. I have two daughters, both in their mid forties. Both married with one child each. I am very conservative financially and have only given them around ten thousand each when buying their first homes and have put away around eighty thousand each for my grandchildren for college. Of course I paid for their college expenses and after any scholarships allowed them to keep any savings after college. I do not pay for anything for them outside fifty dollars each every Christmas. Both daughters work full time and have adequate incomes but I recently found out that they are both living borderline paycheck to paycheck. My wife recently let it slip to one daughter that one day they would inherit more money than they would know what to do with. They have not brought anything up or asked for money. I want to make sure this money goes to making sure my wife and I have meaningful end of life care and enough to take care of any emergency expenses. Regardless any stock sale would trigger capital gains and I do not want to have the government in my pocket. After a recent conversation with a close friend, he called me selfish for not helping my daughters or sharing my wealth along the way. Long time lurker so I wanted to inquire as to AITAH?",
