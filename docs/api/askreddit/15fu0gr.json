There was a set of train tracks that ran through the field so they thought a spark from a train had started it, so we got lucky.  As guilty as I (and I'm sure he) felt we managed to keep our mouths shut about it and got off scot-free.",

   "message": "I was having sex with a woman and her phone rang.  Met her on active duty. She too was active duty. \n\nThis was the first time i ever had sex btw. \n\nShe answered her call and started talking saying that she was at the mall with her friends. \n\nI was doggy style with her and i had stopped. \n\nAfter a min i slowly started up agin, and then she said ‚Äúi love you too honey‚Äù. \n\nI did not stop even when the realization hit me. \n\nI finished, thanked her. Told her we should not see each other anymore because we both had agreed not to get attached emotionally. \n\n Months later i slept with her bootcamp bunkmate who was still in touch with her and she told me that her husband had found out and had threatened to kill me.",
