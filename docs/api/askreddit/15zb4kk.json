At some point you absolutely have to just go live your damn life. I've had days where I *couldn't* get out of bed and have had the bad ideation at times as well, and I'm not talking about those times. I'm talking about the fact that a lot of people cycle through 8000 meds waiting passively to feel better while they're lying on the couch watching Netflix and making no other changes. \n\nIt's not overnight. You need support to do it. Meds can absolutely be lifesaving. You probably have to tackle some problems you would rather ignore. But my point is that if you work on yourself, life can get better. If you don't, it's almost guaranteed not to. \n\nI know so many people who wallow in self-pity and point the blame at anyone but themselves, and then can't understand why they've strained every relationship they have and no one wants to talk to them. My brother in Christ, if everyone you know is an asshole...\n\nAnyway yeah the boomers are right that you have to bootstrap depression a little bit, and not that it's your fault you have it, but you have to work on yourself to make it better. It's easy to stay in that hole, but cut it out. Try harder to live while you're alive.",
