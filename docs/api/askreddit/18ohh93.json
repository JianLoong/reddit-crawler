I didn't want to move so I complained and they let me stay where I was at. The person they meant for me to room with as it turned out when I later met him was a fellow gamer and he was also in an IT major. We hit it off pretty good and he invited me to come work at this noodle place that he worked at. Me being socially awkward and nervous I said no. We ended up losing contact eventually and I regret everything to this day.\n\nAnother maybe opportunity was a guy who asked me to come see him sometime at work down at the Menards. I again never did it because I was very sheltered and had severe social anxiety. But I was bicurious and he told me some stuff that suggested he was gay and he was really cute so I often I wonder if he would have ended up being my first boyfriend. \n\nThose last two were my biggest regrets.",

Some high school kids had discovered bitcoin and were buying it as some sort of cool novelty. Someone even made a bitcoin transaction just to prove that it was real money. Of course at the time all of us thought it was a waste of money to get thousands of bitcoin to get something that costs a few bucks. A lot of the kids there had bought thousands of Bitcoin for pennies, but I personally didn't. Most of the guys who had BTC eventually cashed out shortly after for a small profit and it was just a cool story for most of them that they made 50-100 euros of profit. Not a single person actually held on long enough to make any serious profit, and personally I never bothered to get any.\n\nIf I had spent what I spent in a week there anyways on BTC I'd be a rich man now.",
