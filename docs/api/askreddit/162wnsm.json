No clue how my parents were able to swing it.\n\nWe were sitting on deck on a bunch of big cushions, a group of dear college friends, right after a Turkish-style brunch. Surrounded by absurdly beautiful turquoise water with three or four little islands visible around us, no one else in sight. I remember the nearest island had some random ancient (or ancient-looking) ruins, including a small amphitheater facing the water. It was late morning on a gorgeous day, warm enough that some kids were swimming, jumping off the boat and generally messing around. Others were reading or napping on deck. A professor who was reading with a mimosa said, ‚ÄúSorry, kids, but your lives just peaked.‚Äù\n\nAnd our little group was talking about that, how magical the trip had been so far, seeing the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. Even the richer kids had never been to Turkey. And one girl says, ‚ÄúThis is perfect. Absolutely nothing could make this moment better.‚Äù\n\nAnd RIGHT after she said it, we heard a slight commotion from the kids in the water, looked overboard and saw a tiny boat with a loud motor bouncing over the waves, clearly coming right for us seemingly out of nowhere. When he got close enough, the sole occupant of the boat yelled, ‚ÄúIce cream! Ice cream for sale!‚Äù\n\nWe lost our minds. I was one of the few with my bag nearby, so I scrambled for lira.
