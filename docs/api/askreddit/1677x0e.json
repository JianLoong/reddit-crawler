So alpha wolves, beta wolves gammas and so on, and the pack ruled by an alpha male in an alpha female.\n\nThat is discredited research that was actually refuted by its author . That research was based on captive wolves who formed artificially large packs.\n\nIn the wild, a wolf pack is a nuclear family .\n\nSo if you were going to kill your alpha male and mate with the alpha female, you‚Äôd be killing your father and fuck your mom .\n\nThat‚Äôs why members of the Wolfpack don‚Äôt mate with each other. they‚Äôre literally brothers and sisters and Parents.\n\nNot every wolf has children . And the wolves that don‚Äôt have children helped raise the Cubs.\n\nBut that‚Äôs because those are there siblings!\n\nhttps://phys.org/news/2021-04-wolf-dont-alpha-males-females.amp\n\nWhen people call a human being an alpha male, for instance, that does not exist .\n\nAt least not the way they think it does. They think it means being ultra dominant against other males and often violent..\n\nThat is not a thing.\nI‚Äôll tell you how to be an alpha male. \n\nWhat is An alpha male wolf ?\n\na dad who provides for his family . \n\nüôè‚ù§Ô∏è",

Also, somehow, 100 men 1 time is somehow different in terms of \"usage\" than 1 man 100 times because apparently women have memory foam vaginas that form to a man and therefore many different men mean \"looser\" vagina. That having many past partners affects your about to \"pair bond\" or some dumb shit, making \"ran through\" women less loveable partners. \n\nThe people who spit this nonsense are brainwashed or are just having a fragile ego, because they weren't the woman's first and only, that means they're less special, as if women are a one time use item. Then again, men who think like this DO think of women as one time use items and have a disturbed and distorted view of women. They're gripping their dicks with a gorilla grip and wondering why they can't feel anything. If a woman is loose, it's because she's turned on. No, your girl welcoming you after you being away for some time \"loose \" doesn't mean she cheated, just that she's excited to see you. If she's \"tight\", then that's either medical, purposeful clenching for your pleasure (like kegals), or she's nervous or not turned on enough. That last one is a problem because of you go in before she's warmed up it can hurt her, but if she's to nervous, unless she's a virgin then you're probably not ready and she's not comfortable enough around you.",

   "message": "Black people can not feel pain/have an extraordinary pain tolerance. This is a very common myth that is taught to medical doctors around the world. When Black patients go to their primary doctor or an emergency room to say they have pain, many times they‚Äôre accused of drug seeking. \n\nI always recommend to anyone, get a Black doctor. They don‚Äôt believe that myth and are more open to listen to whatever is bothering you. \n\nI just discussed this with my nurse, who is a Black woman. She said it was posted in nursing school. She even told me she had another parent who went to the ER and they refused him medication.

   "message": "\"Some guy in ancient Rome built a steam engine so therefore the fall of the Roman empire set the course of human history two thousand years.\"\n\nThis one drives me fucking crazy.  It is so unbelievably idiotic on so many levels you could probably teach an entire college course on why its bullshit.  I'll see if I can limit it to a few bullet points though.\n\n- One guy in ancient Rome building a crude, primitive steam engine that had almost no practical use does not mean the Romans were one step away from creating the entirety of the 19th century with all of its thousands upon thousands of scientific, technological, philosophical and cultural breakthroughs.  It's like thinking that two kids who strung two paper cups together with a piece of string are just right around the corner from building a global telecom network.\n\n- The fall of Rome is probably the most overblown event in human history, thanks to brilliant writer but shit-tier historian Edward Gibbon.  Empires collapse all the time and the results are rarely ever apocalyptic and in fact often do more good than harm (just look at all the empires that collapsed in the 20th century and how much nobody misses any of them).  The fall of the Roman empire may, at most, have set back the progress of European culture just a bit but - and it's real easy to forget this if you live in the West - Europe =/= the world.\n\n- \"But just imagine if the advances of the Roman empire had been able to continue unimpeded.\"  Here's the thing: that happened.  It's called the Byzantine Enlightenment and it's one of the most important events in human history that produced some of the most brilliant minds the human race has ever known (seriously, go look up the accomplishments just of Avicenna and Averroes, to say nothing of countless other major Byzantine scholars).  The tide of human progress never stopped: it just shifted from Europe to the Middle East for a few centuries (to say nothing of all the important work Indian and Chinese scholars did during this time as well).  But you never hear about the Byzantine Enlightenment in the West because if there is one thing Westerners don't ever want to talk about it's Brown people proving themselves to be smarter than White people.\n\nIf you've ever wondered what kind of technological wonderland we'd live in right now if the Roman empire hadn't collapsed just look around you.  Steam engine or no steam engine, in terms of science and technology almost nothing would be different (culturally though, who knows?) and can we please stop spreading this stupid, stupid myth?",
