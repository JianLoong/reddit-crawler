Do not mistake me, I loathe the Republican party as it is in this day and age. It's repugnant. That said, I know some of my coworkers and neighbors and even a small number of friends who are Republican, and they're not *bad people*. Again, don't mistake me, there are plenty who *are* horrible people, but *most* of them are *just people*. People who drank from a bad well for decades and now have something horrible in their system and it has poisoned them in a way that can't be easily undone, and it's fucking insidious.\n\nSome of these people I *know* to be kind, but if a voice whispers in their ear that the other side are deranged, stupid assholes without a brain in their head for decades and they end up believing it, they can buy into some propaganda that's unhealthy for our shared society. That's the fucked up thing about propaganda; it doesn't just work on the profoundly stupid, it works on you and me and everybody in between. It's incredibly effective. That's what makes it propaganda.\n\nIt seems like we have **utterly failed** to find the responsible medium between 1) Government controlled media, where you can't post what they don't want you to and nobody has true freedom of speech, and 2) what we currently have, which is a system where you can lie and argue anything in bad faith, omitting half the facts and just making weird sneers to imply that other people are dumb assholes, in the *most disingenuous* way humanly possible, for DECADES, to get a purely manufactured division of people who should be working for the betterment of the country, but who instead will argue about the fucking Barbie movie on the internet so that people stop asking about helping people *before* the for-profit interests of very, very few at the top of the shit sundae.\n\nWe try to clown on Fox News and the rest of the conservative media machine, because what they say is fucking stupid, but the fact is that they are *preposterously* good at what they do, and it's the primary source of just how fucked we are, and I have zero idea and how to unfuck it, honestly. Even if you introduce the regulations or rules or standards now, the poison from the well is already in the people.\n\nSo...yeah, people will say that I'm being extreme, but I honestly feel that people like Tucker Carlson, who will **knowingly** push false narratives that damage millions and millions of regular people, *solely* to make a buck, are ***species traitors***, and the absolute scum of humanity. There probably aren't many *serial killers* who've resulted in a higher body count than Tucker Carlson and that ilk, but somehow working towards the mass detriment of a civilization isn't illegal if you *pretend* you didn't know the lies were harmful.
