   "message": "I used to be extremely judgmental. I don't know if I made a pact with the universe to put me in my place as quickly as possible so that I would learn not to judge but I'm glad it happened. I can remember specifically several times being judgmental and being served the exact same situation what happened to me almost immediately. An example, I had a friend who had an extremely messy house. I talked non-stop crap about her to my husband. I didn't care how overwhelmed or disabled she was. I snarkily commented that she should just make one of her half a dozen kids help. I didn't take into consideration that she was the only income earner working three jobs. Or that her kids were having a lot of social issues. Fast forward 3 months. I had a complete autistic burnout from not getting the medication I need, working in a toxic environment and getting sick. Autistic burnouts can last for years. All of a sudden my house was unmanageable. I didn't have the energy or the mental capacity to follow through with any tasks. My kids helped but they definitely have a different version of clean than I do. My husband is the same. Then at the same time my oldest son came to live with us full time. I shared custody with his grandparents. He's also autistic and was going through burn out \u0026amp; extreme meltdowns due to his grandparents finally being held responsible for abuse. My other two kids hit puberty and immediately lost their minds. All of this happened within 3 months of my judgmental BS. I am still trying to recover and my house will probably never look the way it did before the burnout. You know what that friend did? They offered to come over and help me even though they are also struggling. That is only one of the experiences. I'm very careful about who I judge because I have no idea what they're going through. When I experience what they've experienced I finally get a clue. It's hard for my autistic brain but things aren't always black and white. I'm not going to place judgment if I don't want to walk in their shoes. What I do know is, instead of judging them I ask if they need help. We all need to help each other a little bit more.",
