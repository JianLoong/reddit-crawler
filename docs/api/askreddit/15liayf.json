Which is, ability to get girls isn't just a result of some intrinsic level of ability to do so, where some guys \"have it\" and others don't; nor is it a function of how much you *deserve* it.\n\nA lot of the advice on this question comes down to either \"be a good person \\[according to my definition\\]\" or \"nothing you can do, you're fucked\".\n\nAbility to attract men/women you like is like a skill - some people have naturally have more or less of it, but you can also hone and improve your skills.  And it isn't necessarily a reflection of your moral worthiness, or what you deserve.\n\nAnyway, some basic stuff:\n\n* From the book *How to Win Friends and Influence People* - make eye contact, say people's names when speaking to them, ask them about themselves, and do \"active listening\" (periodically say a word or two back at them along the lines of what they're saying, to show you get it)\n\n* Seriously, **ask them about themselves**.  Everyone loves to talk about themselves.  Most conversations are people staring at the other person, waiting for them to shut up so they can talk about themselves.  Get them on a subject that they like, and they'll go off at 60 mph and you're suddenly like top 10% conversationalists just by smiling and nodding and periodically throwing in a couple \"active listening\" words.\n\n* Have platonic female friends\n\n* You have to actually flirt with and ask out a girl you want to date, you can't just become a friend hard enough that you suddenly start dating, you have to \"make a move\" because she's not going to.",

Respect her hobbies/interests/likes, even if they don't align with yours. \nRespect the fact that she needs to cum too. \nRespect the fact that nobody is ever going to be perfect, and that at times small issues seem like big ones in the heat of the moment, so give yourself time to process and calm it down. But also respect the fact that it's ok to have non-negotiables and deal breakers and you can walk away at any time if your line is crossed.\n\n\nBasically just be a good dude and treat them like you would want to be treated yourself, but also don't be afraid to let it be known if you feel like you're being mistreated, and listen to them if they tell you the same. Have fun, joke around, laugh. But remember they are your girlfriend, not your drinking buddies. You got this dude.",

Feel it out.\n\nBut if you are just aiming for female friends. I wish you luck with all the people who will assume you are dating her first of all… so numero Uno, make it known you aren’t and aren’t looking to. Don’t be a cockblock for her.. Being realistic as often as possible helps too, don’t get caught up in your imagination and imagine a life with your new friend. It makes stuff awkward. \n\nIf you catch feelings with your friend though. Well.. by then I guess you should be able to figure it out. Peace",
