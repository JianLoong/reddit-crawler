   "message": "I am trying to let go of the aggravation. It's not like I don't have time to work at it; all those mindfulness and meditation exercises that I never quite got around to in life? Here, they're a good way to rest, and to spend time when you don't have someone you want to talk to.\n\nI never thought I'd be here long when I found out what was going on. I've never had a lot of friends, and the ones I had were middle aged or better. I wasn't much into social media, and didn't have kids of my own. My nieces and nephews all lived thousands of miles away and I wasn't involved in their lives. So I i figured a few decades and I would be gone. And yet the years kept passing.\n\nIt took over a century before I found anyone who recognized my name. She was a mathematician. I'd played with math as a hobby, despite my lack of education in the field, but with math you don't need a formal education to play around. She was telling me about a discovery that had actually been done while I was alive, but had only been found when someone performed what she called a \"trawl\" to verify their own discovery. There are so many places that discoveries can, or could have been, reported that these are special searches that are done to find any earlier matching discoveries. They don't take as long as I would expect, but computers have come a long way since I died the first time.\n\nAnd then she told me what the discovery was, and who had done the work back in my day. And I *twitched*. See, I have - had - one of those strange tiny-minority-group-that-got-absorbed-and-disappeared last names. Our family was apparently the only one in the world who had it. The name that did not long survive my death; my neice was the last person alive who used it. But while it's long, it's said as it's written, so it's not that hard to pronounce it.\n\nThat wasn't how **she** pronounced it. \n\nIt isn't how **any** of them pronounce it. I can forgive the emphasis being on the wrong syllable--it's not like that is obvious in the spelling. But how do they get off just ignoring one of the letters in my name? Just because there isn't anyone alive who has the name doesn't mean that they get to pretend part of it isn't there!\n\nAnd I'm sure I'd written somewhere how it's said. Not in my math stuff, no, but if they looked hard enough they could find it. But no, it's wrong every time. And when I tried correcting one of them? They had the nerve to tell me, tell ME, that it didn't *matter* that it was mispronounced because everyone knew who they were talking about, and they would just confuse people if the said it differently. It's my name, it's keeping me here, and I can't even make sure they say it right!? The gall of some people!",

   "message": "It's been nine hundred years since I died and I'm still waiting for it all to end.\n\nI was a bit peeved when I found out the rules. There was no God. No heaven or hell. No real afterlife. But there were two deaths. And the in-between. \n\nUnderstandably, I was extremely confused when I woke up after being hit by the drunk driver. I didn't think that I'd somehow survived. The cold expanse of infinite emptiness saw to that. \n\nAt first I'd thought I was in hell. A few other forms floated around but I thought it might be rude to go and speak to them. I wasn't sure what the etiquette was here yet. \n\nAfter a prolonged stretch of time - who knows how long it actually was, time keeping was difficult here - a form floated up to me to ask if I knew what was going on. \n\nI politely explained that I didn't. \n\nThankfully, this form - Adam it said it's name was - had more confidence than I did. They floated straight over to ask the next nearest form. \n\nI hovered nearby and listened in. \n\nI learned that this place, the in-between, was where people went when we died the first time. Here there was very little to do except wait. Apparently we would drift around the void, occasionally being granted 'the feeling' until our name was spoken for the final time and we passed away into eternal bliss. \n\nHonestly it made little sense to me and I kind of started panicking at this point but I didn't want to make a fuss. \n\nSo instead, I drifted back into a particularly spacious section of the void and waited. \n\nA couple of times I got the feeling. From what I understood, this happened when our name was mentioned back in the real world. The feeling was kind of a reward for being worth remembering. Or a punishment for those remembered for the wrong reasons. \n\nThrough overhearing random conversations, I ascertained that the feeling was different for everyone. If people on earth spoke of you fondly, you'd get a feeling of warmth and joy. For me it was like waking up on Christmas morning as a child to find a puppy under the tree. \n\nIf people spoke poorly of you however... Well thankfully it didn't happen to me. The occasional pulse of energy that permeated the void when that happened to someone had a sour taste to it. From what I could gather, its feeling ranged from stepping on a Lego to having your genitals dipped in battery acid. \n\nLuckily I hadn't left much of an impression in my life. I got the feeling a few times near the start. I assumed that was my family. Maybe the couple of internet friends I had. \n\nBut it had been an age now. I wasn't actually sure exactly how long. I drifted past someone who was discussing the year 3004 a while back though so I was certain it had been at least nine hundred years since I'd died the first time. \n\nI couldn't figure out why I was still here. I wasn't particularly important In life. And I don't say that to garner pity, it was simply the truth. My dad died when I was a child. My mum was the only real family I'd had. I didn't have any real friends. Only a couple of people I met through playing games online. All of whom must have died long ago. \n\nThen everything changed. \n\nThe feeling came so often it was almost constant. I found myself in a nearly permanent state of ecstasy. If I'm honest I found it a little embarrassing. It was like I was experiencing a near infinite orgasm of proportions unexplainable to anyone not in the in-between. \n\nEventually, I forced myself to work up the courage to ask someone if they had any idea what was happening on earth. \n\nIt took a few tries. I was almost going to give up, I hated bothering people. But finally, somebody recognised my name. \n\nIt turns out, a historian uncovered some stories I'd submitted online. I hadn't thought they were anything special. Certainly nobody at the time had thought so. But apparently nearly a thousand years later I was a published author. Famous worldwide. \n\nOriginally, I had believed this to be a mistake. Perhaps it was someone who simply shared my name. There must have been billions of us. But no. Apparently the ones speaking your name had to have intent behind it. They had to mean you. \n\nI had been a nobody in life. Not special. Not important. Forgettable. \n\nBut in death. To people born hundreds of years after I lived. I was someone. \n\nI guess that in the end, nothing we do with our lives is meaningless. \n\nSo write your stories. Sing your songs. Create your art. Take risks. Leave a mark. You might not become famous in your lifetime but that's okay. Someone, someday, might just fall in love with you. \n\nI am important. You are important.\n\nWe all matter. \n\n\nVisit /r/SpooksScribbles for more!\n\nEDIT: Fixing my genitals",

   "message": "What do you know of pain? Is it when you stub your toe? Is it when you break a bone? Is it when you break your heart? Or is it when you die? \n\nThe answer differs for everyone. For me, it would always be the suffering I inadvertently caused. \n\n*\n\nWhen I first left the realm of living I was happy. Happy that finally the days of despair and nights of loneliness were over. I was never a people person. I liked being alone. Not because people disgusted me, it was because a part of me always thought that I disgusted them. Except for my parents and a few friends, I never made an impression. \n\nWhich is why I thought that the last time someone would say my name would be in a few years after my death. Friends moved on. Family moved on. Memories remain. But memories don't have voices. \n\nOh, how wrong I was. \n\n*\n\nI watched my friends and family mourn me. I watched as they took my name in fondness. I watched my girlfriend break down when she went to work the first time after my death. \n\nI wanted to reach out and comfort her. But I knew that before a wound heals, it hurts then it itches. She was hurting right now. But I hope she healed soon. I never want to watch her suffer. \n\n*\n\nMy family looked at my photo daily. My mom cleaned the already clean glass of the frame. She didn't blink when the tears fell. \n\nMy dad never stopped saying my name out loud. He couldn't bear it. Every time he thought about saying my name, he saw my mother's face crumble. My sister leaving the room because she felt that she would taint my memories with her tears. \n\nAnd I thought, who said the dead do not feel pain? My soul was edged to the point beyond pain. \n\nI wished I was never born. If I was never born, then no one would have felt this pain.\n\n*\n\nI was mentioned in every breath for the first year. The second year, was the year of healing. Slowly, but surely the wounds were healing. I was happy. They didn't deserve to suffer. \n\nI didn't deserve their love. \n\n*\n\nI watched when my girlfriend had a panic attack when she tried to go out on a date for the first time in two years. She sat at the foot of her bed, tears streaming down her face. \n\n\"Why did you leave me? Why, Joe?\" She sobbed as she watched a photo of two of us together. \n\nI sat beside her, trying to provide some comfort but I knew I was nothing more than a soul desperate enough to reach someone beyond reach. \n\n\"I loved you.\" She said. \"I still love you. Tell me how am I supposed to move on when a part of me already belongs to you? What if I can't love anyone the same way I loved you? What if I love them less?\" \n\nThen in a whisper she added. \"What if I love them more?\"\n\nPeople say the sound of a heart breaking is silent. That is not true. I can hear the way it's shattering inside both of us. \n\n*\n\n\"Joe wouldn't want you to stop caring about yourself.\" My mom says to my dad. \n\nHe doesn't say anything. He just stares at some point beyond her reach. Beyond my reach. \n\n\"Dana needs you. You can't keep it bottled up inside.\" My mom cries. \"She needs you. I need you, damnit!\"\n\nThen with a cry like a wounded animal my dad breaks. Sob after sob tears from him as my mom envelopes him in a hug. \n\nI watch as my sister runs out. I see her face crumble and she is encompassed in my parents embrace. \n\nI watch them break. \n\nI watch as I see them start to mend. \n\n*\n\nI stop watching them after the initial years. It's too painful. And I was never that brave. \n\nIf I were brave, then I would have stayed. \n\n*\n\nTime moves weirdly when you are stuck between worlds. I don't know how many years have passed. I still hear my name but I refuse to watch them anymore. \n\nI am the reason they are suffering. I just wish I was brave enough. \n\nThen one day my sister's voice reaches me. She is crying but they are happy tears. I can hear the distant cries of a baby. \n\n\"I want to name him Joe.\" She says softly. \"He was the strongest person I knew.\"\n\nI cry then because in my heart I want to believe those words. \n\nIn my mind I knew they were a lie. \n\n*\n\nIt feels like eternities have passed since I died. I don't know if any of my family is alive anymore or not. \n\nI just know I hear my name sometimes, a whisper in the voice of strangers. \n\nCuriosity makes me turn back to the world of living. I hear my name and I feel myself being drawn to it. A single person stands on the stage giving a lecture or a speech I don't know. \n\n\"250 years have passed since this organisation was founded by Dana Myers. It was her vision to make sure no person felt like they were suffering alone. She watched her brother battle his demons till one day he lost.\" \n\nThere's pin-drop silence in the auditorium. I look around and see faces I don't know. Except one man who faintly resembles my sister. \n\n\"Mind over Matter will always help those who need help. No matter who they are or where they are.\" \n\nI feel close to tears as I turn to disappear back into nothingness but there is my picture. I move closer then I do break down. \n\n*Joe Myers, the man who thought everyone deserves happiness except himself.*\n\n*\n\n[You can find more of my stories at r/iknowthisischeesy]",

I mean, if i remember correctly, there was even a hyperlink on the Lorem Ipsum wikipedia page that went straight to your name.”\n\n\nThe fellow, only recently arriving in this limbo of an afterlife, has just casually told me the answer to a question that I’ve pondered for… i can’t exactly recall. Decades? Millennia?\n\n\n“O… okay. What does that mean for me? Am i just stuck here forever? Until society as a whole gets tired or bored of my name and moves on to something else?\n\n\nThe fellow quickly replied:\n\n“Well i can’t really say what that means for you. I’m not sure. What i can say however, is that i’m pretty sure society isn’t going to be bored with your name for a while. There was a period of time in my life where your name was a big meme as well. Had quite a few good laughs over some of them.”\n\n\n“Well thats just dandy. Why my name though? What was so special about it?”\n\n\n“Buddy, do you even remember your name? What the hell wasn’t special about it? I mean with a name like Jack Ophofden, how could you ever forget it? Thats a fucking HILARIOUS name!”\n\n\nAnd just like that. I remembered why i was such an introvert in life.",

Floating in Limbo, this swirling black-and-white whirlpool of nothingness, having died so, so long ago, waiting for my *true* death.\n\nThe moment my name is spoken for the last time.\n\nI don't hate it here. In fact, it's quite nice. With practice, you get to imagine all sorts of things for yourself, be the creator of your own little pocket of reality. And I've had a *lot* of practice. I occasionally meet other people - those who died not *too* long ago - but it's a solitary existence for most of it. Just the way I like it. I've... always liked it. Being on my own, with myself, is an experience I always cherished.\n\nBut it does lead me to wonder. Why am I still here?\n\nI've lived a reclusive life. Parents died, no siblings, no lovers. I worked as an accountant from home; my work was submitted online and I barely ever met my coworkers, usually only when there was a mandatory workplace party, during which I hid in the corner and read a book. And then, in my 30s, I died. I didn't do *anything* noteworthy to anyone. So... why am I still remembered? Why am I still talked about?\n\nPeople who occasionally appear here in Limbo talk to me about what the world is like. How after I died, it burned, nearly destroying our race. People turned against one another, ripping each other apart in the streets. How there was no safety and society devolved into small pockets of survivors. But... also how we overcame it. How we *unified*.  How we pushed forward, together! Some of the people I talked to even died during a space expedition and tell me about that; *just imagine*! And all the while, this big event, the one that almost doomed humanity before saving it, one that's taught in schools, has my name right in the middle of it. But... usually, I'm referred to by a title.\n\nPatient Zero.",

   "message": "“And *here,*” the mild mannered dean of the college said to the gaggle of students behind him, indicating a staircase that curled up in a loop to the top floor of the library, “is the famous Adelaide staircase.”\n\nThe distinguished, silver haired gentleman wiggled his fingers and eyebrows, and the students looked up at the architecture.\n\n“Adelaide, see here,” the dean pointed with a gnarled finger to the inscription in the wood. “She was a student, much like yourselves, who came here to study until one night when the building was attacked by a vicious storm.”\n\nThe students “oohed.”\n\n“A hurricane-like torrent came through, and who should be here alone, having fallen asleep, but Adelaide. The brave girl heard a strange cry over the storm and let in a migrating Elk that had been separated from its herd, so they could both survive the night. The pair had only each other as lightning, wind, and rain tore at the building, leveling several of our historic trees. \n\n“Of course this was bizarre circumstances, but the pair waited out the storm together, and when they were discovered by the librarian the next day, the beast had settled beside her, and they had both fallen asleep. We’ve had the Elk as our mascot ever since!”\n\nThe dean’s story was greeted with suspicious whispers, as well it should be.\n\n“Now some say Adelaide and the Elk haunt this staircase, and we only allow faculty to use it, just in case,” the dean said with a wink. \n\n*This* was why I was stuck in limbo? This ridiculous story? I had let in a deer, and we hadn’t cuddled sleeping together. The deer had eaten one book, tracked in mud, and left the next morning without incident. \n\nI tutted and shook my head. Ridiculous.\n\nThat’s when I noticed wide eyed students had turned toward me, the dean stuttering behind them.\n\n“Adelaide!” one of the students cried, and they ran back to the main lobby.\n\n*Goddamnit.*",
