They are both largely wheelchair bound, with one of them able to walk on her own a bit but the other basically either being in his wheelchair or laying on his bed.  The latter once nearly died because the joystick on his wheelchair got caught under his desk and kept moving it forward...it literally would have crushed his ribcage in a matter of minutes.  Fortunately a friend of his was around and had the presence of mind to pull the emergency brake on the battery.\n\nHis parents had constant rumors about abusing him along with a lot of CPS investigations because he'd show up to his school looking beat up or with casts and rumors would spread.  At one point the rumor was his father pushed him down an elevator shaft for some reason, but in reality he'd just fallen while getting into bed and broke like 5-6 bones.\n\nIt's also crazy how not accessible most places are.  The guy made a career off of building an app to track which buildings at a major university were wheelchair accessible despite the university claiming everywhere was accessible (technically true, but you'd have to go a quarter mile around to get to the only accessible entrance.)\n\nIt's fucking bizarre thinking about how a single fall or someone bumping into them could potentially kill either of them. It's kind of nerve wracking in any public setting.",
