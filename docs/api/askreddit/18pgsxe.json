This is partially due to ‚Äògreed-flation‚Äô (corporations using ‚Äòinflation‚Äô as a foil to raise prices. This is evidenced by soaring profits in 2023. If it were inflation, those profits would be eaten by rising costs). It is also partially due to high interest rates (this influences variable interest rates like credit card debt). So, the hope is the government will step in and threaten excess profits tax. Also, it would help if we made stock buybacks illegal again (as they should be).",
