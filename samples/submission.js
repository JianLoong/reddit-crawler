Unlike the name of this subreddit the poster does not have to be a literal devil with horns to fit here. We let posts stay up here often depending on the top comments of the original post: if they agree that the poster is an asshole. If they don’t: please crosspost it to somewhere else, for example r/AmITheAngel. \n\nWe ask you to please read and follow the rules. Here’s an overview:\n\n* Don’t brigade: don’t comment on the original post. Don’t upvote/downvote the original post. Don’t go after the original poster in DMs or in previous posts of theirs. We have a no tolerance policy for this rule. \n\n* Stay on topic: this subreddit is for discussing the crosspost and the poster. Stick to that topic, please.\n\n* Don’t repost: please check the subreddit before crossposting to ensure you’re not reposting.\n\n* Civility: try to remain civil in the comments. We understand that discussions can get heated. You won’t be permanently banned for this unless you’re repeatedly being uncivil.\n\n* No shitposts: this is only a place for crossposts. Don’t make up fake posts. Don’t ask here if you’re an asshole/devil. Go to r/AmItheAsshole etc. for that. \n\nHope you have a good time here!",

                "selftext": "My wife [26F] and I [28M] have been married for about half a year now. We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.\n\nThis summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.\n\nI've tried discussing this with her but there's literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I'm out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I've tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn't care. She says that she's at home all day and so she should have control over it.\n\nWe've argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. \n\nMy wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn't be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. \n\nThe next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say \"Help ... water ...\" I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn't give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me \"controlling\" and hasn't said more than a word to me since.\n\nThings have been rough for the past couple of days. I feel like what I did was completely justified but was I an asshole about this?",

We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried discussing this with her but there&amp;#39;s literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I&amp;#39;m out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I&amp;#39;ve tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn&amp;#39;t care. She says that she&amp;#39;s at home all day and so she should have control over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say &amp;quot;Help ... water ...&amp;quot; I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn&amp;#39;t give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me &amp;quot;controlling&amp;quot; and hasn&amp;#39;t said more than a word to me since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things have been rough for the past couple of days. I feel like what I did was completely justified but was I an asshole about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Were we wrong to have handled it this way.\n\nMy daughter Amy (24F) graduated university a couple years ago and has had several part-time jobs since then. She would work for a few months, quit and look for another job which has better pay. At the end of last year, she asked if she could move in with us (both in our 40s) so she could save money and look for a job in the field she graduated in. That sounded good to us so we agreed. We did not expect any kind of rent or money from her at the time, simply that she would find a job.\n\nHowever, it's almost August and she has not found a job yet. We asked about her job hunt and she said she was still looking and has not had any offers post-interview. I feel tricked and lied to because surely she would have found a job by now, it's been months. She has also never mentioned going to any interviews and it felt like she was lying to to keep living here. Her field is one that is looking for more women to join the workforce. She has been living here for months to essentially do nothing.\n\nSo, I talked with my husband and we both agreed it would be best for her to live with her aunt/my husband's sister as she works in the same industry as the one my daughter graduated in. Maybe she could learn some things that will help her get a job quicker. We then told Amy that she needed to move out to her aunt's while she looks for a job because it's clear she isn't doing enough here and her aunt could help. She was upset, immediately asked that if she contributed to some of the bills, she could stay but we said no and it was time for her get more serious about applying for jobs. She said nothing and packed her bags and left.\n\nWe tried calling her today to ask her how her aunt's house is (she lives an hour's drive away) and did not answer us. Instead, she sent us a spreadsheet/tracker of sorts which detailed job roles, application links, dates and stages of application where multiple said interview. I immediately felt guilty and tried to call her again. She will not pickup and her aunt sent my husband a text asking us to respect Amy's privacy while she stays with her. Were we assholes here?

We have had rough patches where she lacks a sex drive for me.  However, there are also times when she is extremely sexual.  So, I know it can happen for the right person.\n\nThe passionate times are intense, but pretty far in between.  Am I wrong for making my wife suffer through a mediocre sex life because she loves me? She pleases me fully when she is able to will herself to have sex with me, but that life does not seem worth having from her perspective.  Should I step aside (because she never will) and let her find a better man that will fulfill her needs?\n\nEdit: I have tried to do everything I can to please her sexually, but I think I lack the skill, experience, and ability to give her what she really needs.  I have had 15 years and have not been able to give her the experiences that she obviously needs.  Therefore, that is why I have come to this horrible conclusion that I am holding her back and I might be selfish to stay with her.  \n\nAm I Wrong?\n\nEdit 2: Is it a “for the sake of the kids situation” that makes it right for us to struggle through?\n\nI am all in on this relationship, but it just hit me in the last few weeks how heartbreaking it is to make someone stay with you who does not truly desire you sexually.  That has to be horrific to see your SO as a roommate who it is your duty to provide the closest form of intimacy possible.\n\nFinal Edit: I do appreciate the advice, even the harsh perspectives.  I think it was deserved.  I am not on the line with divorce lawyers, I just wanted to get peoples opinions on the situation.  However, while I can read these comments, interacting is taking too much mental and emotional energy.  So, I will read, but I cannot continue to respond.  Just know that I took much of your advice to heart and will try to be better in the future.  Have a good day!",

I feel like an ass since I didn't react with joy like everyone else but I honestly can't support their decision.\n\nThey've only been married for a couple of years so there was plenty of time for them to settle down and have kids, in my opinion, but my friend has always had \"baby fever.\" I'm mainly concerned about their ability to be parents. They both work full-time and when they get home they complain they are \"too tired\" to take care of stuff around the house: cooking, cleaning, etc. They eat out every night because my friend doesn't know how to cook and her husband just doesn't want to. Their house is always messy between dishes, laundry, and general filth.\n\nThey also have poor money management skills, always shopping for stuff they just see and want but don't need rather than buying stuff like groceries to cook actual meals. They've struggled to pay rent a few times because of this. In addition, their house is incredibly small, overflowing with stuff and not a safe environment for a baby. (It's very old and has a lot issues.) Realistically, how do you expect to take care of a baby with habits like that and in a space that isn't suited for them?\n\nWhen I expressed these concerns to my friends, they essentially told me I shouldn't worry about it because \"nobody is ever prepared to have a baby\" and that I should just be happy for them. I get that you're never *really* prepared but you can have a game plan, right? Start saving and making sure you have the stuff and space required? How nonchalant they were about my concerns made me even more anxious; you'd think I was having the baby.\n\nYesterday the topic came up again and my friend asked me if I had changed my mind about it and when I told her no, she was grated. I also learned they are now trying to rush a move to get to a bigger and better house even though she's halfway through her second trimester. She starting getting defensive, saying that just because I don't really want kids of my own that I was trying to \"bring her down,\" and that I should just support her pregnancy rather than being concerned about \"future problems.\" \n\nI told her that she and her husband were too caught in elation to see the reality that being a parent isn't just about cute baby clothes and being a friend to your child. I did get snippy, which I shouldn't have done, but it felt like she was just brushing away what I consider valid concerns. I did eventually apologize, saying, \"I'm sorry you feel that way but I don't think I'm unjustified here,\" which didn't go well because it wasn't a \"real\" apology. Not one she wanted to hear, at least. I just can't bring myself to believe they are responsible or mature enough to have a baby and that makes me feel like a bad friend. \n\nSo, AITA for telling them they're not ready to have a baby and should have waited until they got their lives together?\n\nEdit: Since a lot of people are saying the same thing, I *have* expressed these concerns before, many times, prior to my friend actually becoming pregnant. It wasn't unsolicited, she would ask my opinion and I would tell her these things each time.",

Initially I thought it would be a short lived obsession so I jokingly would say yes we can get one but only when we move in. She seemed very happy with this, fast forward 2 years and we finally moved in together. Once again, the conversation of buying a Borzoi dog game up, I kept deferring it making up excuses such as the flat is too small, we’re too busy and so on. She was mad but she understood so we moved on with our happy lives, Borzoi dog free. \n\nOnce again fast forward another 2 years and we moved into a house, our beautiful dream house, a garden, 2 floors and plenty of space, or as my girlfriend describes it… “big enough for a Borzoi dog. We also found new jobs where we can work from home so we would have enough time to look after this hypothetical Borzoi dog. This is where things went downhill in our relationship. She once again brought up buying a Borzoi dog, I was cornered, my excuses no longer applied. I tried prolonging it out by saying not yet, and bless my girlfriend for her patience she kept sighing and leaving the discussion. Then Covid came and one of the very few perks of Covid were that dogs became extremely expensive and that became my new reason not to buy the Borzoi dog. I milked the excuse during covid but now Covid isn’t affecting dog prices… so her obsession with getting the Borzoi dog has returned.\n\nI should now explain why I don’t want a Borzoi dog. Simply, they’re the most hideously creepy dogs I have ever seen. It’s face makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I cannot imagine having one in the house a running around. It reminds me of the slender man but as a dog. As ridiculous as it may seem, I fear it. My girlfriend thinks the complete opposite. \n\nIt has now become a so much of a obsession she has started buying Borzoi cuddly toys, framed pictures, electronic cases, kitchenware, decoration, ALL Borzoi themed. The Borzoi dog has taken over my house and my girlfriend. We haven’t argued over it yet but my girlfriend genuinely is heartbroken that I won’t get her one. \n\nShe’d cry when binge watching videos of them and it would break my heart so a couple of months ago I finally explained my utter disgust of Borzoi dogs, I explained how the Borzoi dog genuinely disturbs me. She said she that I lied to her all these years promising her the dog, I led her on and that if she didn’t get the dog then she’d consider leaving me. I don’t want to lose her but I can not bring myself to live with a Borzoi dog. \n\nAITA for telling her that we’re not getting a Borzoi dog?\n\nEdit: I love dogs in general but the Borzoi dogs specifically freak me out. I wouldn’t mind getting a different dog but she doesn’t want any other.",

                "selftext": "Two days ago, I (53f) had a surgery to remove a skin cancer. The instructions were to keep the bandage on for 24 hrs and not lift ANYTHING for two weeks to a month, else I may bust my stitches.\n\nI asked my kids for help around the house and they both said they were too busy. One (19f) going out of town and the other (23f) said she had a project to do, (she’s learning a new skill so she can get a better job.) I’m happy the one is getting to have some fun, and the other I’m proud she’s improving her life. But seriously, this sucks. I can’t afford hiring someone to help out.\n\n\nSo I asked a man on our second date to go grocery shopping, so I could feed the cat and get milk. Thank god, he was nice and didn’t mind my messy-ish house. \n\n(I didn’t realize I’d be incapacitated like this or I would have planned better.)\n\nThe next day when I changed my bandage, the wound was bigger than I expected and the ones that I bought were too small. I tried to use one, but it laid on top of my stitches. The pain was terrible, but I didn’t have anything else and it’s on my shoulder blade, so it’s incredibly difficult to get to.\n\nI needed help. I contacted my friends but they were all busy. So I reached out to my daughter who said she was studying a new skill, and I explained that I was desperate for help. I couldn’t see my back, I didn’t sleep much because every time I rolled over, I woke from the pain. She said she could, but not until 10 or 11 pm that night, and she had another thing in an hour.\n\nI called her, I thought I could pick her up quickly, run to the store, and get her back home for her thing. If she was late, I figured people would forgive her because she was helping her mom. She started crying because I was giving her a guilt trip and she needed to breath, exasperated I hung up.\n\nI ended up going to the pharmacy, and the nice pharmacist helped and put it on my back… in the store, where anyone could see. It was weird asking a stranger and being exposed in public, but she was kind, and said I could come back again to put on the bandaid the next day.\n\nNow I didn’t know it would be so easy. I did feel terrible that my daughter cried, and sent a text apology which she hasn’t responded to.\n\nBut I’m hurt. I don’t often ask for help. I ALWAYS bend over backwards, spend time and money (that I don’t have,) do whatever I can for my kids… but this hurt a lot because I really wanted her to help me verses a stranger.\n\nI don’t know what to think and am going around and around in my head. \n\nI’ve never wanted to emotional manipulate my children, I don’t even point out my hardships or how I’ve sacrificed for them, but I LEGIT needed help, was alone, sleep deprived and in pain… also hungry… but that’s another story.\n\nAITA? Is there something I’m not seeing? My parents were never divorced. Honestly, I don’t know what to think of this and would like to take responsibility for my part and make amends if needed.",

                "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, I (53f) had a surgery to remove a skin cancer. The instructions were to keep the bandage on for 24 hrs and not lift ANYTHING for two weeks to a month, else I may bust my stitches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked my kids for help around the house and they both said they were too busy. One (19f) going out of town and the other (23f) said she had a project to do, (she’s learning a new skill so she can get a better job.) I’m happy the one is getting to have some fun, and the other I’m proud she’s improving her life. But seriously, this sucks. I can’t afford hiring someone to help out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I asked a man on our second date to go grocery shopping, so I could feed the cat and get milk. Thank god, he was nice and didn’t mind my messy-ish house. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I didn’t realize I’d be incapacitated like this or I would have planned better.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next day when I changed my bandage, the wound was bigger than I expected and the ones that I bought were too small. I tried to use one, but it laid on top of my stitches. The pain was terrible, but I didn’t have anything else and it’s on my shoulder blade, so it’s incredibly difficult to get to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I needed help. I contacted my friends but they were all busy. So I reached out to my daughter who said she was studying a new skill, and I explained that I was desperate for help. I couldn’t see my back, I didn’t sleep much because every time I rolled over, I woke from the pain. She said she could, but not until 10 or 11 pm that night, and she had another thing in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called her, I thought I could pick her up quickly, run to the store, and get her back home for her thing. If she was late, I figured people would forgive her because she was helping her mom. She started crying because I was giving her a guilt trip and she needed to breath, exasperated I hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to the pharmacy, and the nice pharmacist helped and put it on my back… in the store, where anyone could see. It was weird asking a stranger and being exposed in public, but she was kind, and said I could come back again to put on the bandaid the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I didn’t know it would be so easy. I did feel terrible that my daughter cried, and sent a text apology which she hasn’t responded to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I’m hurt. I don’t often ask for help. I ALWAYS bend over backwards, spend time and money (that I don’t have,) do whatever I can for my kids… but this hurt a lot because I really wanted her to help me verses a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to think and am going around and around in my head. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve never wanted to emotional manipulate my children, I don’t even point out my hardships or how I’ve sacrificed for them, but I LEGIT needed help, was alone, sleep deprived and in pain… also hungry… but that’s another story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA? Is there something I’m not seeing? My parents were never divorced. Honestly, I don’t know what to think of this and would like to take responsibility for my part and make amends if needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I thought this was just ridiculous. I mean, when I was growing up people would let their cats roam around the neighbourhood all day. I've never even heard of putting a cat on a leash. \n\nI brought this up with her but she was very insistent that her cat isn't allowed outside and honestly I find that a bit cruel. \n\nI tried to get the cat outside as much as possible while I was cat-sitting. I would put it on the leash and try to bring it around the garden but honestly, I could tell this cat doesn't get much fresh air, I practically had to drag it around and it didn't seem comfortable at all outside, which kinda saddened me, I don't think cats should live like that.\n\nI ended up letting the cat off the leash and letting it explore on its own which it seemed to enjoy and it was literally fine too. Always came back and I still kept a close eye on it. \n\nI decided to tell my friend that I let the cat roam around freely and it seemed to really enjoy it when she came back, but she got very upset at me. She told me outside cats die much younger than indoor cats and that cats don't need to go outside because they're domestic animals. \n\nShe's still very angry at me and thinks I put the cat's life at risk. I think I did the cat a favour to be quite honest.",

She's never been to the US before so the first thing she did was go to NYC for a week. On the last 3 days of her 7 day NYC stay, my bf and I flew in and joined her, and then we were going to drive to his dad's place and stay there this whole week leading up to the wedding. In the 3 days we spent with her, she gave off the worst vibe. \n\n\nBoth she and my bf are only kids, and they would spend their summers together growing up, but their relationship and her behavior made me uncomfortable. She was really doing too much around him, like you do not need to wear a cocktail dress that shows the shape of your nipples to brunch or be dressed to the nines to walk around NY, or have my boyfriend sing 80s love balads on karaoke with you. She would also pretend to forget words in English even tho she is fluent just to switch to her native language with my boyfriend, or when our server was French she HAD to make it known that she speaks perfect French too. And everytime we would see her she would greet my bf with a hug and kiss to cheek, not me.\n\n\nI confronted my bf about this and he called me jealous saying she doesn't kiss me when saying hi because he warned her about Americans preferring their personal space, but she could've asked me if I would be okay with it! He says her over the top behavior is a cultural difference and nothing more. I wanted us to get a hotel in his dad's town, to get away from her, but he said no. I decided to go along with it because I figured maybe I WAS overreacting, so on Monday we drove to his dad's house. \n\nMy bf's dad and I have a great relationship and as we both work in finance, we love discussing it which always leads into fun political debates as well. She would be all chatty until I start a conversation about something, and then she wouldn't say a word, like she was freezing me out. I booked us a make up artist to come do our make up for the wedding who ended up canceling on us yesterday. The cousin said she would do both our make up, and to have my make up ready in the morning. I told her I only have like 3 products because I don't wear it on a daily basis like she does and then she told me she couldn't do my make up because she doesn't like sharing her make up products as it's unhygienic. But you're okay with a makeup person using their stuff on you?! Come on!\n\n\nAfter that, I went and she and my bf went on a walk while I was showering so I couldn't join them, after we've been going on post dinner walks together all week! That was my tipping point, so I packed my bag and left this morning without saying a word. I texted my bf all of this and he acted surprised, said I behaved and like a child and that he won't let this ruin his dad's wedding. AITA?",

She would be all chatty until I start a conversation about something, and then she wouldn&amp;#39;t say a word, like she was freezing me out. I booked us a make up artist to come do our make up for the wedding who ended up canceling on us yesterday. The cousin said she would do both our make up, and to have my make up ready in the morning. I told her I only have like 3 products because I don&amp;#39;t wear it on a daily basis like she does and then she told me she couldn&amp;#39;t do my make up because she doesn&amp;#39;t like sharing her make up products as it&amp;#39;s unhygienic. But you&amp;#39;re okay with a makeup person using their stuff on you?! Come on!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I went and she and my bf went on a walk while I was showering so I couldn&amp;#39;t join them, after we&amp;#39;ve been going on post dinner walks together all week! That was my tipping point, so I packed my bag and left this morning without saying a word. I texted my bf all of this and he acted surprised, said I behaved and like a child and that he won&amp;#39;t let this ruin his dad&amp;#39;s wedding. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Things have not been so great the last week months.\n\nShe suggested that we go away for the weekend and we booked a weekend break in Amsterdam. We both live in Bath. So not a long flight for us.\n\nI work for an American company on West coast hours. So finish work a lot later then her. But I was able to make arangements to finish early on Thursday. Our flight was Friday morning.\n\nShe has class after work on Thursdays, it is an online course. So not that taxing and she didn't need to leave the house to go. She starts work at 9 am and finished at 5:30 PM. Her class runs from 6 pm until 10 pm. When she finished work she came into my office (I work from home as well). Told me she was going to pack as she had to get up at 6 the next morning to drive. \n\nI told her that was not ok, that we both had to clean up. That she should start, and that when I finished in two hours I would help her finish off cleaning the house. She said she was tired and had been in front of her desk for 13 hours. This is a lie, she had a half hour break between 5:30 and 6. She also has a lot of freedom from her job and constantly leaves her pc for 20 and 30 minutes during the day. \n\nI told her, I didn't think it was fair that I would have to clean the house on my own. She shot back that I shouldnt and that it would be fine when we got back. I HATE COMING BACK FROM VACATION TO A DIRTY HOUSE.  \n\nI told her, that is she wasn't willing to help me clean the house I wasn't going away in the morning. She said \"fine\" told me to \"You do you\". She packed her back and went to bed.\n\nI slept in the spare room and she woke me the next morning, asking where my bag was. I told her I hadn't packed and wasn't going anywhere. \n\nShe flies back tomorrow morning. We have been texting back and forth and she hasn't said anything about me not coming. My mom and dad think I was right not to go. But my best friend said I was being unreasonable. \n\nIs my wife going to leave me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not going on a weekend break when my wife refused to help me clean the house?",

Our name was called and to get to our table indoors we had to cut through the patio.  We got stopped for a few moments behind a table leaving and saying goodbye.  In those moments, a lab type dog gets up and starts sniffing my ankles.  \n\nI look at the owners and say what the hell? and point at the dog.  They just say the classic line of \"oh don't worry, he's friendly\".  I admit I was a touch rude, I just say, \"I'm not friendly\".  They pull the dog back under the table. \n\nThey start saying if you aren't friendly you shouldn't be coming to a dog friendly restaurant.  I tell them just because the place is dog friendly doesn't mean that its okay for your dog to come up to me. I don't want it in my fucking space.   \n\nThey seem baffled that someone didn't like their dog.  He called me an asshole and told me to find somewhere else to walk.  I say fuck off as we head to our table. My wife was like your right, but could have been friendlier.  Was i the asshole?\n\nEdit FYI: Indoors is not dog friendly.  Outdoors is dog friendly.  My wife and I specifically chose indoor seating because it was not dog friendly.",

Our name was called and to get to our table indoors we had to cut through the patio.  We got stopped for a few moments behind a table leaving and saying goodbye.  In those moments, a lab type dog gets up and starts sniffing my ankles.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look at the owners and say what the hell? and point at the dog.  They just say the classic line of &amp;quot;oh don&amp;#39;t worry, he&amp;#39;s friendly&amp;quot;.  I admit I was a touch rude, I just say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not friendly&amp;quot;.  They pull the dog back under the table. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They start saying if you aren&amp;#39;t friendly you shouldn&amp;#39;t be coming to a dog friendly restaurant.  I tell them just because the place is dog friendly doesn&amp;#39;t mean that its okay for your dog to come up to me. I don&amp;#39;t want it in my fucking space.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They seem baffled that someone didn&amp;#39;t like their dog.  He called me an asshole and told me to find somewhere else to walk.  I say fuck off as we head to our table. My wife was like your right, but could have been friendlier.  Was i the asshole?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit FYI: Indoors is not dog friendly.  Outdoors is dog friendly.  My wife and I specifically chose indoor seating because it was not dog friendly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She ended up cancelling because her sister got sick. I had amazing seats along the third base line and didn't want\n them to go to waste so I asked my sister if my nephew would like to go. She asked him and he was really excited. \n\nWe got to the game and he was interested for maybe 5 minutes then he just wanted to sit to the side the seats in the aisle and play with his action figures. I let him for a little while but I was getting really dirty looks from people like I was a bad \"father.\" I made him sit down in his seat and he kept playing with the action figure. I ended up taking them away from him and told him to watch the game. He started saying he was bored and not having any fun and that turned into massive whining. Finally we didn't even make it into the 4th inning and I'd had enough so I took him home. \n\nMy sister was surprised to see us and I explained what happened pretty much expecting her to understand. Instead she asked me what my problem was. I said we went to watch baseball. She said he was watching baseball, he was just playing with his figures at the same time. I said no he was totally engrossed in his action figures. She asked if I was serious. I told her I'm not getting in an argument with her because she was not there.

That evening when we had dinner, he drank this tall glass of water with some chips. The next morning he wasn't up in time for breakfast so I checked his room and found he'd wet the bed. And not for the first time, when I confronted him about it he admitted he'd wet the bed before but hid it from us by getting up early and washing the sheets. Now, neither of his parents told me anything about this, and Zack told me he'd fooled them into thinking that he'd gotten over it and could I please not tell them.\n\nI wasn't too mad because I understand it's not something he can control, but I did make a rule that he has to limit his fluid intake (no sodas, soft drinks, soups, etc.) and that after 7:00 P.M he can't drink any beverages. He's free to break the rules of course, but if he wets the bed again and I find out, I made it clear I'm telling his folks. \n\nMy wife and I got into an argument over it when she found Zack was still awake at like 4:00 A.M. Last night. She's insistent that he's scared to sleep because he might wet the bed and it's because of the “threat” I made to tell his parents. Now, I don't know if she forgot what it's like to be a teenager, but they stey up at bizarre hours all the time. It's not necessarily due to the bedwetting at all, and I told her as much. If he's following the rules he probably won't wet the bed anyhow. She called me a “cold motherf'er” and has been giving me the silent treatment since.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong; it's not a “threat” per se, telling parents is just the right thing to do if a kid keeps having issues. AITA?",

He&amp;#39;s a nice kid but unfortunately, as I found out a few days ago, a chronic bedwetter. That evening when we had dinner, he drank this tall glass of water with some chips. The next morning he wasn&amp;#39;t up in time for breakfast so I checked his room and found he&amp;#39;d wet the bed. And not for the first time, when I confronted him about it he admitted he&amp;#39;d wet the bed before but hid it from us by getting up early and washing the sheets. Now, neither of his parents told me anything about this, and Zack told me he&amp;#39;d fooled them into thinking that he&amp;#39;d gotten over it and could I please not tell them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t too mad because I understand it&amp;#39;s not something he can control, but I did make a rule that he has to limit his fluid intake (no sodas, soft drinks, soups, etc.) and that after 7:00 P.M he can&amp;#39;t drink any beverages. He&amp;#39;s free to break the rules of course, but if he wets the bed again and I find out, I made it clear I&amp;#39;m telling his folks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My wife and I got into an argument over it when she found Zack was still awake at like 4:00 A.M. Last night. She&amp;#39;s insistent that he&amp;#39;s scared to sleep because he might wet the bed and it&amp;#39;s because of the “threat” I made to tell his parents. Now, I don&amp;#39;t know if she forgot what it&amp;#39;s like to be a teenager, but they stey up at bizarre hours all the time. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily due to the bedwetting at all, and I told her as much. If he&amp;#39;s following the rules he probably won&amp;#39;t wet the bed anyhow. She called me a “cold motherf&amp;#39;er” and has been giving me the silent treatment since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I did anything wrong; it&amp;#39;s not a “threat” per se, telling parents is just the right thing to do if a kid keeps having issues. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Sadie and I have been together officially a bit over 2 years. We got together when Jo was about 4-5 months, but I’ve known Sadie since a bit before she found out she was pregnant. \n\nAnyway. We moved in together over a year ago and Sadie works from home and keeps Jo home with her to save on daycare costs. I work 2 jobs for the time being so I can get my hours up for my certification so I can be eligible to work alone and not under someone. Because of this I am often tired. \n\nI never have days off and by time I get home I basically have enough energy to eat dinner and pass out. The whole situation started a while ago when Sadie mentioned she would like to try to go out once or twice a month. I explained i might not be able to commit to that but I’ll try my best. \n\nAt first it was ok but bringing Jo along with us prolonged the evening often or wasn’t as relaxing as just a date so by the end of the night I was either irritated or more tired than before. \n\nWe had a talk and Sadie agreed to put Jo in part time daycare so we could have more adult time together. But she only put her in 3 days a week and it’s usually during the times I’m working so when I get home I still don’t have a break or just adult time, but Sadie does. \n\nRecently one of her cousins moved close to us and Sadie paid him to watch Jo after hours so we could have a date. I had an amazing time and suggested Jo pulls her from daycare and just has her cousin watch her for date night once in a while. \n\nWe got into an argument because she feels like I just don’t want to be around Jo and I feel like I should be able to request alone time with my lady away from a child that at the end of the day isn’t my responsibility. Sadie said I knew from day one what I was getting into when pursing her but I feel like I signed up to be with HER not be a replacement dad. I understand Jo will always be there, but Sadie can’t expect me to be happy to see an upset toddler after working 15-18 hours at 2 jobs nearly EVERYDAY and the few times we get to go on a date we have to spend most of dinner making sure Jo doesn’t have a tantrum or is entertained. \n\nI love Sadie I really do, but since Jo is hers she should be responsible for finding childcare and making sure we have alone time. I just don’t think I’d push my kid on a partner that didn’t have one. Sadie went to stay with her cousin and has been responding very vaguely whenever I reach out. AITA?",

The father isn’t in the picture. Sadie and I have been together officially a bit over 2 years. We got together when Jo was about 4-5 months, but I’ve known Sadie since a bit before she found out she was pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway. We moved in together over a year ago and Sadie works from home and keeps Jo home with her to save on daycare costs. I work 2 jobs for the time being so I can get my hours up for my certification so I can be eligible to work alone and not under someone. Because of this I am often tired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I never have days off and by time I get home I basically have enough energy to eat dinner and pass out. The whole situation started a while ago when Sadie mentioned she would like to try to go out once or twice a month. I explained i might not be able to commit to that but I’ll try my best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first it was ok but bringing Jo along with us prolonged the evening often or wasn’t as relaxing as just a date so by the end of the night I was either irritated or more tired than before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had a talk and Sadie agreed to put Jo in part time daycare so we could have more adult time together. But she only put her in 3 days a week and it’s usually during the times I’m working so when I get home I still don’t have a break or just adult time, but Sadie does. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently one of her cousins moved close to us and Sadie paid him to watch Jo after hours so we could have a date. I had an amazing time and suggested Jo pulls her from daycare and just has her cousin watch her for date night once in a while. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got into an argument because she feels like I just don’t want to be around Jo and I feel like I should be able to request alone time with my lady away from a child that at the end of the day isn’t my responsibility. Sadie said I knew from day one what I was getting into when pursing her but I feel like I signed up to be with HER not be a replacement dad. I understand Jo will always be there, but Sadie can’t expect me to be happy to see an upset toddler after working 15-18 hours at 2 jobs nearly EVERYDAY and the few times we get to go on a date we have to spend most of dinner making sure Jo doesn’t have a tantrum or is entertained. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love Sadie I really do, but since Jo is hers she should be responsible for finding childcare and making sure we have alone time. I just don’t think I’d push my kid on a partner that didn’t have one. Sadie went to stay with her cousin and has been responding very vaguely whenever I reach out. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I usually work at night and the closing shift has duties that we do before we close the store. Usually we have me and 2 other people closing up. The duties for the closing shift are all things that drive me insane such as vacuuming, sweeping, cleaning the glass cases and mopping. My sensory issues cause me to not do these duties and I just stick to filling the bags. \n\nLast night we were busy and had to start on our duties later than usual and this meant we had to stay longer in the store. My coworker \"Tonya\" (26F) was visually upset and I asked her what was wrong? She said it wasn't fair I only did one thing every night and that we all had sensory issues we put aside to help out and I should push past them too so we could all go home quicker. This upset me because no one ever takes my autism seriously and in the moment I called her an ableist jerk who has no right in making any requests for me to do anything. She froze and when I walked away, my coworker said she was quietly crying to herself while mopping. \n\nDid I cross the line or was I right to defend myself? AITA?\n\nEdit to add some info: I never told my bosses or anything about my sensory issues bc I thought it would mean I wouldn't get the job.\n\nI work closing because it's the shift with the least amount of customers and I don't have to be out on the floor as much and I can do my daily routine before work.\n\nWe get a sheet that we assign ourselves closing tasks to at the end of the night so we can split them and they always ask what is up to doing and I always say bags and ask if they would be fine with handling everything else BUT they always say it's fine. \n\nAlso my mom cleans my room/apartment because she knows how hard these tasks are for me.",
