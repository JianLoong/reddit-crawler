   "message": "Lots of meme answers here. Let me give an honest one.\n\nIt depends on the person.\n\nMy advice is to think about the person you're going on a date with and try to make choices that make them feel like you noticed the little things about them.\n\nI'd generally stay away from restaurants because eating detracts from your ability to chat, but some guys are foodies and love finding new places or being there at grand openings. For those guys, a restaurant might be a great choice if you can find one they haven't been to yet.\n\nI'd generally say to avoid movies for the same reason: can't talk in a theater. But same caveat, some guys are film buffs and love sharing experiences like that and talking about them later.\n\nThe point is that you can do something safe like drinks at a bar or club, or even an improv or comedy show. If drinks aren't your thing then something simple like a walk works great.\n\nIf you think he'd be light and playful enough for it, then challenge him to a thrift shop. Tell him he has an amount of money to buy something for himself, and that he can't go over budget. You split up and do the same, and meet at the register in 10 minutes. If you have good stores nearby then you'll easily find out the kind of person he is by what he buys.\n\nIf that sounds like it wouldn't work for either or both of you, then try staying in and cooking together. One person can create a shopping list and host, and the other person has to go buy the supplies. The person making the list isn't allowed to say what it is or show the other person the recipe, and the shopper does the cooking based off of what the host describes. It's a way to enjoy a meal, good or bad, and make it something you can talk about and do together.\n\nThere's tons more you can do, but the point is that you want to do something that he'd find fun, will allow him to feel good about himself, allow him to share some of his hobbies, and will be good conversation and allow you to know him better.\n\nIn the best case scenario you have a second date, and in the worst case scenario you have a lot of fun together and understand friendship is where it's at.\n\nThe biggest thing is to remember that it's for both of you and it isn't an interview, so you need to give him back whatever energy he ends up giving you. You are auditioning for him just as much as he is for you.",

Also something that can easily be extended if things are going well is nice too.\n\nThat's why I like coffee or a drink.
