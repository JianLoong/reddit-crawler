Then he grabbed her wrist in a death grip and pulled it away.\n\nShe was sure he was done with her. I tried reassuring her but, frankly, I was filled with dread because I had just given my first hand job a week earlier, to my now boyfriend, and I started wondering if it was equally bad but he was just too polite to say. \n\nWhen I broached the topic he \n\n1. Laughed his ass off at the other guy‚Äôs suffering and\n\n2. Assured me he wasn‚Äôt too polite to let me know if I was about to shuck his dick.",

First he told me about an anime he likes and while telling me about it he said he knows he shouldn't be watching it, I thought he meant as in he is too old for \"cartoons\" he is in his 40s for context.\n\n\nSo I told him \"hey man, there's nothing wrong with liking anime and he should watch it and not care what others think.\"\n\nThen he started explaining it was because they are evil and have satanic messages. I was like oh boy. I tried not to be judgemental, I had bad experiences with people who thought this so it did make me a little uncomfortable though.\n\n\nA little while later we were at a Christmas party we were having in class. There was a music video of a drag queen in class on the TV. He was saying some pretty homophobic stuff, but not going to far with it so I just thought it was just very mild homophobia and he wasn't doing it intentionally.\n\n\nThen after the party was ending we were pretty much alone and he came to me and said \"you know, I just don't like homosexuals.\" \n\n\nAnd I was kind of shocked because I am Bisexual and while I have seen homophobia before I have never seen it this blatant and said like it was completely normal. So I got uncomfortable and tried to keep social interactions with him to a minimum. (Hard because we are in the same class)\n\n\nNow he constantly goes on homophobic, racist, and sexist rants. I have been calling him out a lot lately, but I feel like I should maybe stop. Because it's like I am talking to a brick wall and I almost feel like I am going down to his level somehow.\n\nHe is starting to really dislike me now, which is cool because I am hoping he'll stop talking to me when he sees me shopping/walking down the street or in class.\n\n\nAlso I now wear a bi pride pin and bracelet to class because I feel like it annoys the hell out of him.\n\nTLDR: classmate feels guilty for watching anime because it's satanic, I try not to judge him even though I had bad experiences with people who said this. He ironically tells me he is unapologeticly homophobic, not knowing I was BI and goes on sexist, homophobic and racist rants Offen. And I gotta go to class with him 3 days a week, fun...",

   "message": "A friend of my wife had been unlucky in love for a long time and finally met the guy of her dreams. I hated him from the second I met him. He had these beady little evil eyes, weak handshake, squeaky voice and he just felt very slimy. He could not look anyone in the eyes when he spoke and he was very gropey. He kept saying he works in intelligence and none of us pushed it any further than that, but he kept trying to make it a point that he was a spy for the Government. Alarm bells were going off in my head all night and the next day I had to tell my wife's friend to be careful but she made me feel like shit because she thought I was trying to sabotage her final chance at love. About a year later, she finds out the weed has a wife and family, he did work for the government but only as an accountant. He had basically been preying on her vulnerability and fabricating this elaborate story to keep her on the hook. They had an investment property they were remodeling which he pretended was his own house and thats where he took my wife's friend.",
