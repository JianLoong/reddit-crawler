They thought he was yelling \"sick him\" to attack. It was pretty funny as they would see the wagging tail and licks as he would approach.\n\n The whole neighborhood started to run with it yelling Sickem at each other once he got let out, as he would stop at each house, even go inside if doors were open just to say hi for a minute and get some cuddles. And fortunately in the 90s everyone got a good laugh out of it and actually ended up in the local paper as the 'friendliest scary dog'. \n\nThe dog was amazing but lived a short life bc of cancer with the breed 😔 RIP Sickem.
