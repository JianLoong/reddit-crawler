I'll be so horny I feel like I'm high, and I desperately want to look at porn (which is typically what happens). \n\nThis is usually around the time I start getting wet dreams. If I can push through to make it to the wet dreams, that usually helps a lot. But after the first wet dream, making it to the second is incredibly hard.\n\nWet dreams are amazing and way better than masturbating to me. Unfortunately, even if you never masturbate it still takes like 2 weeks in between them. And since you are never masturbating, 2 weeks feels like forever. I'll be so sensitive that an erection lightly rubbing up against my underwear will have me close to orgasm. I can ejaculate without stroking at all. Just pulling back the foreskin is enough.\n\nSorry, I'm really horny right now amidst a nofap (no, I'm not one of those. I just really like being horny) period. What was the question?",

It was less than 10 minutes from my grandparents' house, so I politely asked them if I could stay there, and they were delighted to say yes. Helped out my grandparents around the house, and got solid experience, good pay, and home-cooked meals for two months. \n\nThe problem... was that I found a disconnect between my brain and my body when it came to masturbation. My body wanted more and more for sweet release,  until about a month in, I got serious,  painful blue balls. But any time I even thought about jerking off, it'd be interrupted by thoughts of my grandparents in the other room, and all arousal would instantly vanish. \n\nBy the end of two months, I was walking bow-legged, as the rubbing of my balls on my thighs felt like agony. The entire time I had kept my girlfriend apprised of the situation,  and she promised to help with the problem. \n\nShe was my first stop after leaving my grandparents' house at the end of two months. She let me into her apartment,  and dropped to her knees. She was so eager to help. I was eager for her to help. Definitely TOO eager for her to help. She made it to unzipping my pants and taking my cock out. \n\nBut after two months of no masturbation, I was on such a hair trigger that even the slightest touch set me off. I came all over her  - two months worth. \n\nAs she ran to the bathroom to clean herself off, I got light-headed and damn near fell down in the hallway. \n\nSo two months.  I can make it two months.",
