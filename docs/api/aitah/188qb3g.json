 "selftext": "My girlfriend and I have been together for four years and living together for two.  My girlfriend's  friend (we'll call her Sarah) is at our house at least four days a week and often more. \n\nI wish she would let us have some space but that's a battle I've lost.  \n\nI typically buy the groceries for our house, and I noticed that every single night Sarah is over, she eats whatever we cook but never contributes anything. In the past two months, she has contributed one box of kraft mac \u0026amp; cheese, and a 12 pack of Pepsi. She's had 20+ dinners at this point. \n\nI've got a buddy coming over tonight who always contributes when we eat together. Sarah is also going to be there. I'm buying steaks for dinner because I work hard for my damn ribeye and she's currently sitting at my house with the expectation of eating it. \n\nI called my girlfriend and said I'd buy the steaks, shrimp, and wine but I'd like everyone to pitch in (obviously not my girlfriend- mostly just want Sarah to pitch in). \nAITAH?",
