Another time I was at a movie, accidentally elbowed the guy next to me, turned to apologize, only to discover he and I had been sitting next to each other the whole time without realizing it.\n\nAnd still another time I was walking along campus when I heard someone calling my name and turned around to see it was him, except he wasn't calling me but his brother, who happened to have the same name as me and happened to be walking alongside me.\n\nBut wait, there's more.  Late in my college career I had to move into a new apartment that was a fair bit away from campus.  After heading out into the lobby from signing the lease guess who I see in the lobby.  \"Of course you live here,\" I said to him.  \"Actually it's my girlfriend who lives here,\" he said.\n\nOne last one: I walked into a convenience store.  The woman behind the counter squints at me and says coincidence guy's name.  No, I correct her, I'm me.  Then she tells me about a guy who she became friends with because she kept winding up in unexpected college courses with him.  It was the same guy.  \"You two look like you could be brothers though,\" she said to me.  No, I told her, only brothers in coincidence.",

Needed a break from life so I talked to a buddy who has a wealthy family that doesn't require him to work. We went to his parents house 3 hours south of where I live for a week. Day 2 or 3 of being there, I decide I need a new cellphone. So I get a burner phone from Best Buy. I register it and realize I get an area code from my hometown and not in the town I bought it. \n\nThe next day I get a text from a number I recognize. Since the phone is new, I have no numbers or info saved. I ask my buddy if he recognizes the number. He looks it up on his phone. It's a good friend of ours that I have known since grade school. I ask \"how did you get my number?\". He said he always had it. I ask \"who do you think this is?\". He responds with another friends name.\n\nA friend from our group changed numbers and carriers a month or two prior. I randomly got his old number. From a retailer 3 hours south of where I lived. \n\nAll my friends already had my number. They just had to change names. Fucking weird.",

   "message": "One summer about 20ish years ago I was a little bored when I woke up and decided that for the whole day I was going to take something inconsequential from wherever I was, and swap it for something everywhere I went, so like I started with a mug from my house, went to a friend's house, he swapped it for a pen or something, and so on. After four or five times of doing this, and hanging out with a bunch of different people and explaining what I was doing, this chain ended with another friend giving me his Yellow Pages (back when it was still a physical thing that was sent to everybody), which I put in my bag and immediately forgot about.\n\nThat evening I was at a house party in the countryside with most of the people I knew at the time, we'd all decided to drop acid, apart from the guy whose house it was, and a couple of others, and by a few hours later we were all tripping heavily and laughing our arses off. Great times.\n\nOh, the coincidence? A few hours after that when things were starting to wind down, one of the girls in the group walks into the room and asks the owner guy \"Hey do you have a Yellow Pages? I need to call a taxi and I don't have a number.\" He says \"Sorry, we don't have one. Do people even use Yellow Pages anymore?\"\n\nI'm still tripping but I hear this and yell \"WAIT, I DO! Here you go!\" and I reach into my bag and pull out the Yellow Pages from earlier. She looks confused, takes it and asks me \"Why the fuck do you have this?\"\n\nI look her dead in the eye and say \"I have absolutely no fucking idea.\"",
