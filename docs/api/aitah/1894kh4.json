 "selftext": "\nWell, people wanted an update and here it is. My daughter is refusing to talk to me and she has moved in with her mom and said that this is permanent.\n\nMy son moved in here with me and I can see that he really enjoys it here. I have been blocking my ex-wife’s number for periods at a time because I have been receiving all kind of threats and insults from her saying I have manipulated my son against her. My son is a very quiet boy and he never given me any impression that he’s been having a bad time at his mother. I inly noticed when he moved here and started talking and opening up about how miserable he’s been.\n\nThe rat, my daughter decided to free him and she and her mom drove to the woods and just let it go. Not expert on rats but that’s the story.\n\nMy gf and I have decided to get a dog. Maybe that would change my daughter’s mind about not visiting although I must admit that life has been so much easier now when she isn’t around making everyone go on eggshells not to set her off. Both her and her mom refuse therapy \n\nOver and out",
