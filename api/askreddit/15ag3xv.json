Our inability to detect them can largely be attributed to the vast expanses of space and time.\n\nFor instance, even if a civilization comparable to ours existed on Proxima Centauri, our closest star at 4 light-years away, our current technology would not be capable of detecting their radio signals due to signal weakness.\n\nFurthermore, their societal and technological development would have to align precisely with ours. As a species, humans have only had the capability to send and receive radio signals for slightly over a century. This is an extremely short span of time when contrasted with the billions of years of Earth's existence, illustrating the minuscule chance of aligning with an alien civilization in terms of technological development.",

However, based on what we know of how energy works, their ability to move between galaxies etc would require energy production at a scale in which it would be difficult for our space surveillance systems not to have picked up on. So his assessment was essentially that the aliens that exist are probably not technologically advanced enough to even be able to communicate with us, based on how we understand space travel and energy to work. So its not that they dont exist *per se*, its more that we dont have an ability to understand how they would be able to visit us.",

   "message": "Most people say \"yes\" roughly because \"the universe is ultra big\".  \n\n\nLet me present a counterargument.  \n\n\nIt is easy to imagine that universe is so big it is pretty much infinite. That logic hints that it must contain all sorts of stuff including many different life forms.  \n\n\nHOWEVER  \n\n\nWe don't quite know yet how life emerges from lifeless material. Because of that, we can't truly estimate how probable it is. As far as we are concerned it may be pretty much so rare that one could say it is \"infinitely\" rare...  \n\n\nNow in an infinitely big universe everything, even the rarest thing should happen. But ... we don't have any evidence that confirms that the universe is truly infinite. As far as we know it is just very big. Every time infinity pops up in physics is because of a math glitch of a physics model not reflecting the nature of reality. I think even most scientists when they say that universe is infinitely big they don't really mean it - they are just saying that it is VERY FKIN BIG.\n\n  \nSince the infinity of the universe is not provable let's just assume that it is VERY FKIN BIG.  \n\n\nBack to life from lifeless matter - we don't know how that happens and we are not even close. OP didn't specify what 'kind' of aliens he is asking about so I am assuming civilized and intelligent ones. So for that to emerge there are some conditions that must be met for the most primitive life forms to emerge, then they have to become multicellular, then they have to have the possibility to evolve, then the evolution has to take the right path, then the intelligent species has to survive long enough to learn about the world.  \n\n\nThis is a very rough description, there may be steps before my description and after which we don't know.\n\nNow imagine that list of conditions and events required to happen in order is long. It may be very long. It can be infinitely long. Nah infinity does not exist so let's say the list of the steps is VERY FKIN LONG.  \n\n\nAssuming all that it is easy to imagine the probability of it all happening could be low. If the list contains 1000 steps and each step has a 1/6 probability of occurring (like rolling 1 on dice) and each step requires the one before to happen correctly... The probability can be VERY FKING LOW. Like throwing 1 on a dice 1000 times in a row. Now we don't know how many steps there are but some steps may be ridiculously improbable. Like they have a chance of happening 1/10000000 or much fking less.\n\nTaking all the above into consideration the universe probably is VERY FKIN BIG but the probability of intelligent life forms emerging is probably VERY FKING LOW.  \n\n\nSO HOW ARE YOU ALL SO SURE THE UNIVERSE IS FKING BIG ENOUGH FOR THIS EVENT OF VERY FKING LOW PROBABILITY TO HAPPEN MORE THAN ONCE?  \n\n\nHere are some yt materials on the topic (watch in order, or watch only the first one).  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wa1l7M5gU8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wa1l7M5gU8)  \n[https://youtu.be/\\_Tju7EaSfmM](https://youtu.be/_Tju7EaSfmM)\n\n  \nKind regards\n\nyazoodd",
