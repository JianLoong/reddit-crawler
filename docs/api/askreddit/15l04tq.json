Like... you're angry because I just happened to have watched a popular show 10 years ago? \n\nIf you happen to be curious on the details, then read below, otherwise above pretty much summarizes it.\n\nIt had came up because we were talking about funny reading related stories we had read in the past and I mentioned of a story where a character had read everything ever, even to the point of being caught reading seed packets. The story ends with the character going to an alternate dimension just to read and her friends locking her on the other side temporarily. \n\nMy date laughed her ass off at the story, but when she asked where it came from, I admitted it was a mlp fanfic from almost a decade ago. She then became agitated, slandering all fanfiction (not just mlp), and then found one of the YouTube videos that focused only on the bad side of the mlp Fandom. She even became accusatory, as if everything bronies did was my fault. Like... I didn't even bother finishing the series. How much of a fan could I be? Seriously, unless someone brings it up or I happen to see something mlp related, I forgot the show even existed. \n\nI thought we were over it after a subject change and an hour later, but when I came back from taking a shower, her last response was a \"goodbye. This won't work out\" and blocked me. \n\nI'm getting too old for this shit.",

I told her it really isn’t something I’m into, but I love that she is and I just like spending time with her.\n\nThat was not enough for her.  She felt sort of betrayed like I was pretending to like something just to placate her.  Maybe she was right, but I didn’t really have any bad intentions other than I liked seeing her happy.\n\nShe insisted we watch a movie that I like.  So I put on one of my favorite indy comedies (The Puffy Chair) and she hated it.  It’s a very typical type of movie that I like.  We didn’t even get through it.  She kept complaining about how boring it was.  The next night she broke up with me over text.  Maybe I should have started with Lost in Translation?",
