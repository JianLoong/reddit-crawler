I had always told everyone what happened and they‚Äôd always kind of roll their eyes and shrug me off when I‚Äôd say I remember everything and go into great detail about it. \n\nHe stated that he had watched all of the videos so many times he had them permanently stuck in his head, but with all angles they couldn‚Äôt tell if my son touched the car at all during the impact. I kept telling him that I took all impact and the kid was injured from impact on the road. (He suffered a TBI, amongst other things, but is a happy and healthy kid now!!!)\n\nWhen he called to tell me that the dna was in from the front of the car and that I was right. Only my dna was on the car. That I‚Äôm a bad ass super woman for reacting as quickly as I did because my son wouldn‚Äôt be alive if it weren‚Äôt for my grabbing him and spinning him away so quickly. \n\nNot only did he say it so casually and naturally, but he validated everything I had always told everyone. He made me feel a little less insane. He also made me feel like the best mom on earth. I was very happy my husband and sister were with me when I got that call because I cried so hard. ü•π",

   "message": "In Italy it's common that young kids (6 to 13) go to a summer camp where teens and older guys and girls teach them some kind of creative activity or sport, and all play together in the free time, and on the last day there's a big party where teams show to parents what they have learned and do some kind of performance (dancing, singing, theater etc) and they get points. At the end one of the teams wins and all get different prizes.\n\nSo, back when I was 15 I was the leader of the blue team and there was this girl in my team who was like 6 or 7 that I often helped and played with because she was the sweetest. The last day our team did the best performances (all while playing \"Blue\" by Eiffel65) and we won. Later that night during the afterparty for all the kids she comes to me and says she has a present, but to only open it when I would be home, so I did.\n\nIt was a thank you card handmade by her that said \"thank you for playing with me\", with a bracelet attached. It made my day and week and month.\n\nFlash forward 7 years, my mom met her mom (they were old friends) and she asked about me, university, etc usual things. My mom asked about her daughter and she said that she also wanted to be one of those teens at the same summer camp, and she wanted to do it because of me, because she loved how much I listened and cared for her and her friends, I taught a lot of things and I was the big brother she never had. She wanted to do the same things I did for her, for all the new kids. And I don't know what to say, I'm speechless and I still don't believe it, it's been about a month now and I'm not over it yet.\n\nI know it's not really a compliment but I thought it would fit here anyway :)",

She complimented me. Told me I was cute. She kept telling me that I could get laid easy in her country because the women are friendly, that they love American accents, and that I was considered \"exotic\" because I was tanned and a minority, apparently a lot of European women like men with tan/dark skin. And she kept telling me to just talk to women normally and that I could get girls the normal way. She kept encouraging me to get women the normal way instead of having to resort to paying. She was telling me most of the men she saw were older men, but she was telling me since I was so young, that I should just try talking to women. \n\nThe sex was great. Was she being genuine with the compliments? Honestly I think so, but it probably was because I payed. However I do believe that she genuinely meant it when she told me to stop resorting to paying women for sex and to try to pursue it the normal way.",

I later found out she was asked about it during her performance review, specifically if she had checked if I hadn't made any mistakes. Apparently she had answered something like \"I didn't need to check, because I know if [ConstableBlimeyChips] did it, it was done right.\"",

   "message": "\"-I like your smile. The sun must be jealous, it's so radiant.\"\n\nNot a gross pick up line, but a charming compliment from a sweet old lady while we were in front of a shop, waiting for the opening. She also complimented my bag (a T.A.R.D.I.S. one gifted to me by a friend), and told me I had very pretty eyes, like the forest.\n\nIt all started when I complimented her hand-knitted sweater, which was a rainbow patchwork of crazy colors. And her glasses, not very common: she had heart-shaped glasses.\n\nShe made this (at the time) 19 year-old very happy, I was smiling for the entire week!\n\nWherever this lovely lady is today, hope she's smiling as much as she makes other people smile.",
