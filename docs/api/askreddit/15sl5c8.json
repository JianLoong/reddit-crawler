   "message": "Tenured academic faculty, particularly in biomedical research. Most of their time is spent begging for more money to do research, which they do not actually conduct. Technical aspects of the job are handed off to younger staff or graduate students, burdening them with research responsibilities that may only tangentially relate to their own projects. This has a dual effect of 1) preventing the younger staff from developing/disseminating their original ideas and 2) generating the perception that the tenured faculty is an expert in more things than they actually are. As a result, grant funding that should go to the next generation is pooled with old people who are out of touch with the field, resulting in stagnant research.\n\nBut if you say you think the NIH is bad, you are automatically \"anti-science.\" No clear solution to this problem. I think it's a generational thing, at least in the US.",
