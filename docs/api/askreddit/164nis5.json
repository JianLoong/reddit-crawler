And it shows the consequences of following a messiah figure when that person is not really a messiah. Paul's actions and inactions have their ultimate repercussion when his son, Leto II, is forced to become a half human/half sandworm God Emperor that rules the universe with an iron fist for 3000 years. Leto II does this knowing full well that he's the villain of the story, but he does it to teach humanity the lesson they should've learned from Paul.\"\n\nI could keep going but I have to work.",

A lot of people who think that rats are gross just never met rats, and when I say 'met' I don't just mean seeing one sitting sadly in its cage at the pet store. I mean actually get to interact with the little buddies. They're so friendly and curious. They're much friendlier than your average pet mouse, and yet mice have a much better reputation and it's really undeserved. Rats are so much smarter than mice, too. They have complex little personalities - if you have 2 or 3 rats, I can guarantee that you will be getting 2 or 3 different rat experiences, because each one will have its own little behavioral quirks and preferences. Really the only tragic thing about rats is how short their lifespan is and how susceptible they are to health problems, because it's really tough to deal with it when they get sick or have to be put down.
