 "selftext": "Personally I really liked that monsters would scale to your level. Even with that I still felt plenty strong. Monsters trailing behind in the higher tiers is just bad for xp gains. \n\nWith the changes to scaling, doing renown at higher levels feels very bad. Pre season 1 I gained a fair bit of levels doing renown in WT3 and actually killing monsters. Now I ignore all overworld enemies and just speedrun side quest/non nightmare dungeon objectives, gaining most xp from completing side quests not killing monsters. \n\nEven outside of renown, there is zero incentive to do anything other than helltides, legions, and world bosses in the overworld after about level 55.",
