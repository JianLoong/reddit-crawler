   "message": "Ready Player One. \n\nIt's far from a great movie of course, people tell me to read the book instead every time but I don't care because the story is secondary to me in it. It's just a great home theater demo, the soundtrack is very punchy and makes use of all of the speaker channels you have very well. It has great picture too if you have the TV to show it. It's just good enough that you can put it on and just enjoy seeing dumb stuff like the delorean and Akira's bike racing Kong, the Iron Giant fighting Mecha Godzilla while the subwoofer shakes my walls, all the speakers are busy with everything going on and everything looks great.",
