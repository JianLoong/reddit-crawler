However, one day I woke up and thought to myself \"If I could end it, then why haven't I tried x, y, z to see how I do first\". I started working out, giving myself a regime and started organising my life the best I could. I wasn't looking for progression as such, just a way to keep busy. However, time passed on, and I was looking much better, my confidence improved, and I got more motivation and held onto it with both arms, almost a death grip.   \n\n\nThat was my medication tbh. Everyone is different. But finding the time to improve yourself, even if it's for just passing time can have many benefits in the long term you might not even realise.",
