Like even her husband and children didn't know until right before the end. She didn't want to burden people with her problems and wanted to live a \"normal\" life as long as possible. On the one hand I think it's pretty badass. But on the other hand having all that come to you in a week sounds more traumatic than slowly watching them die over a couple years. I respect her decision though. It's going to be painful for those around you either way. Nice to preserve normal life as long as possible I guess. Still had to be pretty brutal for her husband and kids when they found \"Oh btw your wife/mom is about to die.\"",
