Of course you don't use numerals, they probably wont understand them, just put dots on each side to show the number.\n\nAny civilization advanced enough to have space travel would recognise it, it's fundamental to physics really. Even if they don't use *our* version of Pythagoras, it demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle. Assuming they have some semblance of morality and aren't just saying \"Show us cool shit or we blow you up\", it shows that humanity is a developed species with advanced reasoning and maths. Hopefully they go \"Well, these guys have it at least a *little bit* together, probably shouldn't demolish their planet for our new intergalactic superhighway\".",
