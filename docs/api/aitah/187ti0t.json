 "selftext": "I take the bus home from school. One of the girl's that goes to my school also lives in the same building as me, so we're usually on the same bus at the same time. Yesterday there was a big car accident or something and the bus got stuck behind it for a long time. So by the time we got to our stop it was dark out. So she wanted to walk the rest of the way home next to me, but my mom had asked me to pick up groceries because we had nothing at home. The grocery store is on the way. She was annoyed that I said I wanted to go to the store and asked me to walk her home first. I was tired and I didn't want to have to go back out once I got home though so I went into the store and she went in with me. Then in the store she got even more annoyed because I was taking so long. I took long because I was comparing prices to figure out what was cheaper and figuring out which coupons worked with what. Then something on the shopping list confused me so I had to call my mom about it. My mom then asked me to also pick up a prescription so I had to wait in line for that too. So we were probably in there for over an hour, but I didn't really keep track so I can't say how long for sure. On the way back to the apartment my neighbor was all stressed out and today said I was a jerk for taking so long because she had stuff she needed to get done yesterday too.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;",
