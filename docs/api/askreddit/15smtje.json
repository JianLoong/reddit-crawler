But my bf's family ate it all the time so I kinda had to try it one day while staying at his. I genuinely thought the food itself was disgusting and never touched it again (I'm now 34yo).\n\nAlso Papa John's. I used to love it but one day, about five years ago we ordered and the cheese was full of long strands of human head hair. I practically threw up on the spot. Haven't had takeout pizza since.",
