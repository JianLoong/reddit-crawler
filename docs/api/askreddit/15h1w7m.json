Things like bending my fingers backwards to touch the back of my hand, touching my arm with my thumb, bending fingers into a Z shape etc.\n\nI was at a party with classmates and this girl I vaguely knew asked me for a private demonstration of my hands. I was slightly buzzed at the time so I said sure and took her to the kitchen while she giggled. I started doing my usual tricks but I quickly noticed something was wrong because she got this disappointed look on her face. She mumbled something akin to \"ok cool\" and left the party claiming she was tired, leaving me confused for the rest of the night.\n\nIt took me 3 days of sobering up before I realized I had fucked up and by the time I saw her again it was too awkward to talk about.",

She 100% wanted to come with me alone to my parents‚Äô house so that we could hook up. I guess it was because I‚Äôd never thought of her like that. She was decent looking but not a stunner. Not someone I‚Äôd probably hook up with sober. But I still feel bad about how demoralizing that must have been for her. She sent all the signals short of just jumping me, and it went straight over my head.\n\nWe did end up hooking up at a party a year or so later, so hopefully that gave her some peace about the situation. But yea. I‚Äôm not a smart man.",

Rihanna broke out into stardom letting us know we can stand under her umbrella, you could buy a house despite having no income, and Taylor Swift was promoting her music career on MySpace - I‚Äôm unsure if Tom was in her top 8.\n\nI was taking the SAT on a Saturday and ran into a girl I had a huge crush on.

She let me know that her parents and 7 siblings went on vacation for the weekend but she stayed behind to take the test. \n\nShe invited me over to her home that night to watch a movie. Her house was huge, probably due to the fact that we were upper-middle class and she had 7 siblings.

Jess let me in and let me know that she had to change so I should go up to her room. \n\nI went to the room with her. As Jess undressed, I turned around to be modest. She changed into soffee shorts and a sports bra.\n\nJess suggested we go to the attic to watch a movie on a small tv instead of the living room with the 50 inch Plasma TV because, and I quote, \"Nobody will notice if we make a mess up there.\" \n\nI froze. Jess and I watched The Guardian starring Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. So, we watched the movie. And we kept watching the movie. And then the movie ended. \n\nDespite doing nothing the entire time, Jess asked if I wanted to stay the night with her. If I couldn't be even dumber, I wanted to go home and play Halo 3 on Xbox.
