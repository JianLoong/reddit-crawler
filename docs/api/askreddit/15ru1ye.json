Now imagine that its blooms must be pollinated either by hand or a small variety of Mexican bee, and that each bloom only opens for one day a year. Now imagine the fruit of this orchid, a pod, being picked and cured, sitting in the sun all day, sweating under blankets all night for months until, shrunken and shriveled, it develops a heady, exotic perfume and flavor. \n\nNow imagine that this fruit’s name is synonymous with dull, boring, and ordinary.\n\n-Alton Brown, on Vanilla\n\nSo that. To be fair there’s a ton of crappy vanilla ice cream out there, but good vanilla is unbeatable. \n\nIn the absence of proper vanilla I gotta give the nod to mint chip, salted caramel, or bourbon pecan.",
