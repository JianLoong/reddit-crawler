 "selftext": "As we usually have so many negative posts (unfortunately rightfully so) about driving in Melbourne, I thought Iâ€™ll share an opposite experience. \nI was driving to work this morning when a car driving next to me beeped multiple times, I looked over and the older gentleman was pointing at my car. At first I thought, that it was just usual aggressive telling off because Iâ€™ve done something he didnâ€™t like, but the beeping didnâ€™t seem aggressive enough.ðŸ˜‚ Sure enough when I arrived at work, one of my tires was looking rather deflated. Iâ€™ve no idea how the other driver noticed it, but Iâ€™m so grateful for that. It turns out I had a slow puncture caused by a nail, which I got fixed for $40 before going back home. If the guy didnâ€™t alert me, there is no way I would have noticed it and would have attempted to drive 50km home, definitely would have damaged the wheel and I doubt I would have managed to get home, causing delays to other cars in the peak hour. \n\nThank you to those who look out for others, people like you restore my faith in humanity. Have a good night everyone!",
