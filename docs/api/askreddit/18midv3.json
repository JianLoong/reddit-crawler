Not 14. \n\nAn x-fold increase of something is useless without the baseline too. 3 times more likely to get a cancer that usually occurs in 4% of the population gets you to 12%, but a 3x increase of something that happens 0.4% of the time is 1.2%, not that spectacular an effect.\n\nFor the individual neither matters, if you get it, it sucks.",
