   "message": "Better plots, worse graphics.\n\nBack in the day... The graphics were laughable. Even mega-realistic films for their time required quite a bit of imagination to ignore the wires and shitty CGI. It may have been better than anything prior but... Even growing up in that time... It never looked real. Not like today. So to compensate, more time went into the storytelling, the dialog, etc. rather than spending 2 years in post adding in 15 different fully CGI and completely lifelike characters.\n\nAlso, movies are very much in the same place as video games right now. Sure, you could have this fresh new idea... But chances are if it hasn't been directly done before, the elements are definitely already present in existing media. I mean you can make another natural disaster movie but... We have one for earthquakes, global warming, tornados, hurricanes, tsunamis, sharknados, volcanic erruptions, etc... Is yours *really* gonna be that much different?",
