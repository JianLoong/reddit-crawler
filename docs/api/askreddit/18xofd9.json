   "message": "A strange one, but bowling. A few years ago my girlfriend and I went bowling at a local Bowlero and it was maybe $60 for shoe rental and 2 hours of bowling for two people. Just recently we checked prices online so we could go again, and the same rental and playing time is $150! Insanity.\n\nEdit to add: this is the only bowling alley left in this medium size city. It used to be an AMF bowling alley before Bowlero. I looked around and the next closest one is in a small town an hour away, so not really viable for quick fun entertainment. And regarding Groupon deals: I checked the app and Bowlero isn’t running any deals there currently. \n\nI just checked to see what the pricing would be during peak time, and it’s even more insane: [$242 for two people, one lane for 2 hours, with two shoe rentals.](https://imgur.com/a/m0hFfkW) They added an “event fee”but it’s in no way an event. I hear it’s cheaper if you just show up, but for them to even have that listed is crazy.",
