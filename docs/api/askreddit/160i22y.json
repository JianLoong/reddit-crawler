My man stood there eyes closed urinating, took his left hand and put his hand down the back of his jeans, swiped his butt like a credit card, then sniffed hard on this fingers. You might think that‚Äôs bad however he then took the same hand, squeezed it down the front of his jeans and sniffed even harder. The worst part was that on each grand inhale he was groaning incredibly loud. He managed all of this whilst peeing by the way, didn‚Äôt spill a drop. \n\nTo this day he doesn‚Äôt know I saw it, he most likely still does it, and I get a great big kick out of seeing him knowing what I know, seeing what I have seen",

A guy came in with a little boy on his shoulders.  Where he was standing the boy could see past the privacy screen right at my business.  I just froze.  Couldn't do it.  The little boy went \"Daddy, that man can't pee.\"  Zipped up and hustled out head down.  Had to stop at the next fast food restaurant so I could finally pee.",

I wasn't allowed to go alone so I hit the call button and a woman I went to school with 20 years ago was my nurse. Instantly recognized each other and stood there like \"what now?\" I hopped out of bed, said \"long time no see\" and limped my way over to the bathroom and she was like, Oh yeah, job stuff. I finally blasted ass and it was glorious. Haven't seen my shitmate since.",

I was working at a hotel and using the bathroom there when this happened. So I just finished my business and walked out. I used another bathroom close by to wash my hands then I went and notified security. Shit was really awkward.",

I got up Monday morning, jumped in my car, drove five hours nonstop to my little college town, parked my car, ran up a hill then five flights of stairs, and - with just minutes left before the start of my class - dove into the bathroom.  I unzipped and started to relieve myself in the urinal when everything went black.  Next thing I know, our Chinese exchange student was shaking my shoulder as I lay on the floor with my penis hanging out of my pants and a wet patch running down my pant leg.  The poor guy hadn't learned the right words for this  situation... I said thank you and sheepishly snuck into class.\n\ntldr; drove 300 miles before running up a mountain and passing out mid-stream in front of exchange student.",
