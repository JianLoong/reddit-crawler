I was at least three states away from anyone I knew, and due to COVID wasn‚Äôt making any friends. I was having trouble keeping up with tuition, books, and all the other bs fees university bleeds you for, and could barely afford the peanut butter and milk I was surviving on. \n\nThe only reason I could afford to go to university in the first place was my mom was loaning me money for it. Despite eventually dropping out, I was very grateful that she was willing to help me out and made payments back to her faithfully.\n\nOn occasion I‚Äôd receive a check in the mail from the university, it was always after I had paid tuition for the semester. It was whatever the difference was between what I paid for tuition and what it actually ended up costing. Usually a couple hundred bucks, and I‚Äôd always tell my mom and send the money to her to help pay back the loan.\n\nOne day I got a check in the mail for roughly $5k. I cashed it and kept it a secret from my mom, even though it really should have been her money. I was still living quite frugally, having that $5k to be able to fall back on helped me so much. I wasn‚Äôt always stressed about how I could afford my next meal or if I needed to fix my car or whatever. The guilt was intense but I was able to live with it.\n\nThat same year I met my best friend. She was a few years older than me, had just gotten married (to the legitimate worst person I‚Äôve ever met), and clearly recognized that the starving, scared, alone kid her roommate had invited over for dinner once needed someone in their corner. She was there for me when I was ready to kill myself, and saved me from starving to death or killing myself in my dorm and letting the RA find my body.\n\nAbout a year and a half later she decided she wanted/needed to leave her husband, and mentally was in just as bad of a place as I was when she first met me. At one point she said she‚Äôd do it but she couldn‚Äôt afford to get out of the relationship. I still had some of the money I kept from my mom, and I asked her how much money she would need to get herself out of her current situation.\n\nI sent her the $2,000 she said she‚Äôd need and told her to do what she needed to do. She tried to say no but I refused to take that as an answer. She said she‚Äôd pay me back and I told her not to. At the time it honestly may have been the only choice I had made in my life that I was 100% certain was for the greater good. \n\nYears later, we‚Äôre both still alive and are much better off mentally. We both still struggle, but that $2,000 I gave to her is nothing in light of the fact that she saved my life and I was able to do the same for her.",

   "message": "When I was 12, I was playing alone outside my house. I noticed a car circling the neighborhood. Soon afterwards, the man who was driving the car stopped about 50m away from me, wound down the window and gestured me over. I felt strange but didn‚Äôt think too much about it and approached his car.\r  \n\r  \nHim : Hi there, do you live around here?\r  \n\r  \nMe : Yes.\r  \n\r  \nHim : Great! I‚Äôm actually a little lost. Could you tell me the nearest way to xx Street?\r  \n\r  \nMe : Oh, just go straight this way and then turn right once you come to a T junction. (How hard can this be right?)\r  \n\r  \nHim : I‚Äôm a little confused. Do you mind hopping in and showing me the way? I‚Äôll bring you right back afterwards.\r  \n\r  \nI was a little hesitant but said yes nevertheless.\r  \n\r  \nThe moment I got into his car and he locked the doors, that was when my heart raced. I realized just how dumb I was and what a ginormous mistake I had made.\r  \n\r  \nIt was too late anyway. So I sat in the front seat and prayed for the best. I directed him to the place he wanted to go to and instead of taking me back home, he ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô missed a turn and took me to the next neighborhood, which was about 2‚Äì3km away.\r  \n\r  \nHe eventually stopped his car next to an abandoned building saying that we would get down and I would help him look for something in the building. I was scared. So I just obliged. He then told me that the door on my side was faulty and that could only be opened from the outside. He said I could only get out through his door. Instead of opening my door for me from the outside OR stepping off the car so I could exit easily from his side, he sat in the driver‚Äôs seat the whole time. Which meant at some point of trying to get out, I would be sitting on his lap. Worst part was he kept the doors locked longer than he should, enjoying every moment.\r  \n\r  \nEventually he let both ourselves out, led me into the building, and started holding me so close. To say that I was terrified was an understatement. Before he could do anything else, I ran out of there as fast as lightning. Just bolted, didn‚Äôt even look back and ran all the way home. Boy, did I run. To this day I‚Äôm so thankful that he did not tie me up or had me in a way that I wasn‚Äôt able to escape. If I hadn‚Äôt escaped, God knows what would have happened to me! Never told a single soul about this incident my whole life.",

I saw the question \"What is the capital of Somalia?\" on the board.\n\nNo one else was in the room yet, so I looked it up in an encyclopedia from the shelf.\n\nWhen it was time to answer, I raised my hand.

I pretended that I heard it on the news while my parents were watching.\n\nI got all kinds of recognition. Dude called my parents. I got some small rewards like a break from homework for a week.\n\nWhat made it worse was that one of my classmates apparently SAW me looking it up through the class door and tried to rat me out.\n\nThe teacher got so mad at him for trying to disparage me that we bonded and I had an excellent year. I of course acted completely shocked and offended at such an accusation, right to his face. I can still remember him looking at me, knowing I'm lying.\n\nThe classmate shot me daggers until we graduated high school.",
