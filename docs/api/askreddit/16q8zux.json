Then it was to win her back. Then It was because I had no more money and people wanted me to. I need a reason, and \"to save your life\" doesn't cut it. Death sounds like a relief at this point. I won't do it myself. Been there.tried that. Won't put family through it again. But they don't know I use. I keep it low key so it's all on me.
