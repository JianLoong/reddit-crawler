Charge scientists to publish in them (in the thousands) also charge the public to read them (subscription also in the thousands). Convince other scientists to review the scientific content for free (exploiting younger scientists who need to build their CV). \n\nBasically putting a pay wall on the results of government tax dollar funded research. \n\nDon’t get me started on how major Universities deal with STEM PhD students. Bringing people in as “students”, make them work 40+ hours a week in lab, purposefully misclassify them as students when really they’re workers, apply for large government grants using data generated by these students, make them do all the grading for the undergrad classes, and then complain when the students are begging for 40k/year. Instead tell them they’re lucky that as “students” they don’t have to pay tuition to be there. At the end of 5-7 years of this treatment they’ll give you a PhD. SCAM.",

   "message": "**Yelp.**\n\nThey target small businesses and weaponize reviews. They encourage an entitlement culture where people are incentivized to leave hundreds of reviews in order to become a Yelp Elite and get free items at Yelp events. \n\nThey aren't allowed to remove customer reviews, but they use their algorithm to move selected reviews into the \"not recommended\" section, which essentially is removing them. They use this as a carrot and stick approach to initiate advertising with them. And they are relentless when calling, sometimes 3-4 times *a day*.\n\nIf a user leaves a false review which publicly names a person by name, posts a photo of them, and even makes a legally-confired libelous statement about the person, Yelp may not remove the review.

Unsurprisingly, many end up crippled and destitute if they're lucky or dead before fifty if they aren't.
