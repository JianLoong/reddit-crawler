   "message": "Terminator 2. It's an absolute masterclass in using action to tell a story and develop character. \n\nModern action movies are often a string of \"impressive\" effect shots connected by a thin story, sometimes not even a decent story that makes sense. \n\nI think Terminator 2 is so perfect because it came along in a time when technology was improving, but hadn't completely taken over. So it's not completely reliant on fantastical special effects. Even though it's science fiction, the stunts are still very real and grounded in reality.",
