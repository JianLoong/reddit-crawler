   "message": "Blue Buffalo and a lot of other pricey pet foods.  These companies spend a lot more on their marketing departments to come up with ads making common ingredients in pet foods seem scary.  Nutrients are more important than specific ingredients.\n\nIngredients listed on pet foods are by weight, which does not necessarily correspond to having a higher amount of product.  Water tends to weigh more and items with a higher water content will be listed first.  When things are listed as \"meal\" this means the company is trying to save money by using a dried version of the product.  By-products = items not normally sold for human consumption like organ meats, which dogs will eat first with a fresh kill.",
