   "message": "That I'm very helpless and insecure. It's a result of my disability. Disabled people generally struggle with the problem that able-bodied people frequently infantilize us. In my case, this may be stronger than in others because I'm blind. When you're blind, your body motions and especially the way you walk tend to be very cautious. This has multiple reasons. For starters, I obviously don't want to get hurt (it still happens but I try to avoid it). Secondly, I don't want break things. For example when I'm at an unfamiliar place, I'm always super rigid and careful because I'm scared I will knock over something and cause a giant mess (it has happened before). Thirdly, I also use my hands to explore my surroundings. When I step into a room, I can't just \"take it in\" in a single glance like sighted people can. I need to explore it with my hands and my body. This takes much longer than simply looking at something. Not being able to see also means I need to memorize everything. For example I need to memorize where the door is, how far away it is from the table and so on. This takes up tons of brain space that sighted people can use for other tasks. Sometimes I get lost and I need to re-orient myself. I know it sounds funny but I've even managed to get lost in my 2-bedroom apartment once or twice. I know these situations quite well by now, so they don't stress me out as much as they used to. I simply gather my thoughts, touch my surroundings and after a minute or two, I'm re-oriented. However, I've noticed that sighted people find it very hard to watch this. They want to help me (which is nice) but seeing me like this also gives them the impression that I'm a lost little child who's feeling completely insecure.\n\nThis view of me as a blind person can be very frustrating sometimes, especially when I'm trying to talk to a woman. I'm an adult and I actually feel just as confident as the next person. I just look more insecure and helpless because I'm slower, because I bump into shit and because I sometimes get a little lost. But it's not actually a big deal. It just takes extra patience on my part to deal with those situations.",
