A captured KGB spy claimed the Soviets thought the same thing (how believable that is depends on how much you trust captured KGB spies).\n\nSouth Africa DID have a nuclear weapons program that they eventually abandoned.  Supposedly they never set one off.  Israel has nukes, this is an open secret.\n\nWho did it?  Was there a nuclear detonation at all, or did the spy sat report a false positive?",
