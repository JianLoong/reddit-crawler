Things like bending my fingers backwards to touch the back of my hand, touching my arm with my thumb, bending fingers into a Z shape etc.\n\nI was at a party with classmates and this girl I vaguely knew asked me for a private demonstration of my hands. I was slightly buzzed at the time so I said sure and took her to the kitchen while she giggled. I started doing my usual tricks but I quickly noticed something was wrong because she got this disappointed look on her face. She mumbled something akin to \"ok cool\" and left the party claiming she was tired, leaving me confused for the rest of the night.\n\nIt took me 3 days of sobering up before I realized I had fucked up and by the time I saw her again it was too awkward to talk about.",

Rihanna broke out into stardom letting us know we can stand under her umbrella, you could buy a house despite having no income, and Taylor Swift was promoting her music career on MySpace - I‚Äôm unsure if Tom was in her top 8.\n\nI was taking the SAT on a Saturday and ran into a girl I had a huge crush on.

She let me know that her parents and 7 siblings went on vacation for the weekend but she stayed behind to take the test. \n\nShe invited me over to her home that night to watch a movie. Her house was huge, probably due to the fact that we were upper-middle class and she had 7 siblings. I rang her doorbell and Jess answered wearing yoga pants - brand new at the time and a halter top that exposed her stomach. Jess let me in and let me know that she had to change so I should go up to her room. \n\nI went to the room with her. As Jess undressed, I turned around to be modest. She changed into soffee shorts and a sports bra.\n\nJess suggested we go to the attic to watch a movie on a small tv instead of the living room with the 50 inch Plasma TV because, and I quote, \"Nobody will notice if we make a mess up there.\" \n\nI froze. Jess and I watched The Guardian starring Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. So, we watched the movie. And we kept watching the movie. And then the movie ended. \n\nDespite doing nothing the entire time, Jess asked if I wanted to stay the night with her. If I couldn't be even dumber, I wanted to go home and play Halo 3 on Xbox.

We talked a lot and I liked her but always just thought she was way out of my league.\n\nAbout a week after our prom that year I was telling the teacher about how crappy it was because my date kinda ditched me.  He said \"well why didn't you ask ____?\"  When I told him how I never considered it he laughed at me and was like \"Man, you've been missing a lot of easy signals.  Don't worry, you'll get there.\"\n\nApparently being oblivious was my strong suit.\n\nEdit: Probably should have added that she graduated shortly after and I never had the chance to ask her out, etc.",

'Come over here so you're next to me' she pats the cushion. So I sit next to her. 'Can you have a look at my neck as it's a bit sore'.\n\nSo I lift up her beautiful long blonde hair and gently rub her neck which she literally starts purring at.  \n'Just kiss my neck a little' so I start nibbling her neck, then she suddenly says 'You should stop, that's really turning me on'  \n\n\nDumbass me:  'Ohh ok then' and I went and sat back on the chair.  \n\n\nHer look of total distain was well deserved and it wasn't until I was heading home that I finally clicked what was going on with the empty house, bikini, neck thing.\n\nIn my defence I was a total novice with the fairer sex at this point, something I made up for with a vengence over the following years at University.... :D",
