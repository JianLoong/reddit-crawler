 "selftext": "Looking at getting some of the Victorian Energy Upgrades such as showerheads etc installed. From my understanding there's a lot of installers out there that take advantage of this scheme, using underpaid labour that do a terrible job. Has anyone that have had these upgrades done used an installer that they'd recommend?  Tried Googling, but there's not much discussion around actual legitimate installers",
