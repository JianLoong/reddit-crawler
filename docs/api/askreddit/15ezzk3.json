They deliberately understaff and it's common for there to be 30 minute long lines when people order lunch. Customers get frustrated cause it takes forever, employees are frustrated because they need help, everyone starts getting agitated, people start bickering. It's just a dumb situation that could easily be avoided if they'd just schedule one more person instead of being cheap on labor costs.",

Then  they changed their menu since other companies like Costco started to offer rotisserie chicken and they felt threatened. The move to a stereotypical thin margin fast food offering coupled with large footprint locations meant they were losing money hand over fist. Their extremely successful marketing campaigns only made it worse. This led to the fastest contraction of fast food locations at the time(ever?). Therefore placing it in my mind, as the worst fast food restaurant.",
