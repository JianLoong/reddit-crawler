   "message": "I don't know if this is the *highest* paying job, but corporate sales, like SaaS (software as a service) companies. Base salary's usually around the $40-50K mark and usually on-target earnings are somewhere around $100-120K. And this is reachable in your first year or two; your success is determined only by yourself. Usually people don't like doing sales and it's a pretty high turnover industry so they'll get anyone who has any sort of customer service or relevant experience like being a server at a high volume restaurant.\n\nAs you get more experience you can either move into more of a leadership role and get a higher base salary + a smaller percentage of your team's sales numbers, or if you just love selling, you can look for jobs that have a higher priced product so your commission numbers are higher overall.",
