The hard thing for my mother is that she moved to a country away from her extended family and my father didn‚Äôt have any family close. So she was at home all day looking after us. There was a lot of time that things were normal but she would slip up and drink and it would last 2-3 weeks where she would be drunk every day and as a young child I recognised it very quickly. She would come to us in the evening slurring her words and asking us to play games or watch films which actually scared me because I knew she was drunk and I didn‚Äôt want to be near her. It made me sick seeing her become a different person. It broke my heart and kind of broke me. My older brother would start fights with my dad and the whole house would erupt into chaos. Originally I kept running away because I couldn‚Äôt process or stop what was happening. Eventually I began to dissociate sometimes and pretend it wasn‚Äôt happening. But the violence from my brother and father clicked me back into reality and I had to step in. As a young boy I was exposed to the worst types of violence and threats which did benefit me in a way as I never took shit from people at school and never felt threatened by bullies because compared to my brother they were nothing. There was choking, broken bones, fists flying, threats of being stabbed and killed.\n\nIn terms of my mother she eventually admitted herself after she almost ran away with another man and realised she needed help. She has been sober for over a decade and worked incredibly hard to make up for what she did and caused. So whilst I still remember and feel for everything that happened, I‚Äôve come to learn that she was simply someone who became lonely and desperate and wanted to escape but couldn‚Äôt control her addiction. I know despite everything she always wanted to be a good mother.",

Ended up marrying a woman who really loved chaos and enabled him.  When I was about 11 she let me know that he wasn't ever actually an addict my mom just made him really unhappy. At that point,  he did a weird thing though, he starting drinking occasionally but I never saw him drink to excess after that.  Almost like he could control it, which went against EVERYTHING I've ever learned.  I did Ala Teen and they told me it was impossible.  BUT his behavior/personality was 100000% an addict.  Nothing was his fault, everything and everyone was making him a victim.   He was an incredibly toxic and traumatizing person.  BUT he grew up with a violent alcoholic father.  His life growing up was horrible.  When I became a mother and my kids were older, I saw the life they lived and compared to the life he lived and it broke my heart.  He didnt even have a chance.  So I was able to find empathy for that terrified little boy who had no safe place to go ever and forgive the man he became.  \n\nThat being said, forgiving someone who isn't sorry is incredibly hard.     I cut him out of my life about 15 years ago and didn't forgive him until quite a few years after that and still don't have him in my life.  My forgiveness is for my own well being, not his.

She doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about!‚Äù (She extremely high functioning. She‚Äôs so high functioning you wouldn‚Äôt know she‚Äôs autistic unless she told you). Myself and my other siblings were to scared to say anything \n\nOnce my mom and later my step-mom divorced my dad, he went crazy with stalking.

He‚Äôd also stand outside our apartment building before we‚Äôd moved and wait for her outside. He‚Äôd call multiple times per day (when I eventually got my first cell phone in 2012, I made the mistake of giving him my number. Even when I was in school he‚Äôd call me non-stop. It was a regular occurrence for me to have 20+ missed calls in under 30 minutes).

Went all the way to 42 while becoming a severely abusive/violent/unpredictable alcoholic along the way.

   "message": "In some ways and not others; I'm not sure i can put it into a yes or no answer. My mother was an alcoholic and drug addict, single mother to me, an only child. She went off the rails plenty early before I came along and the cracks got wider when I was born; I was physically, emotionally, and psychologically abused by her. \n\nWhen she managed employment, it was as an aged care nurse. I was lucky to have so much family around me that noticed things going awry, so I was taken from her custody fully when I was around 11, into the care of my grandmother and her husband. She tried to get clean a few times, plenty of stints in rehab and plenty of slippery slopes back down into the depths of the addictions. \n\nBy the time she passed 2 years ago, we were no contact on my terms. It ate me up a lot, and I spent a long time thinking her death would solve my complex feelings. I was very wrong. It hit me so hard and I mourned everything, including the loss of hope of what could have been. I myself used alcohol as a crutch, but quickly figured that I would rather end up in a psych ward than go that way. It felt terrible, but it was still so hard to stop.\n\nIm 25 now and through that I learned how much harder it must've been for her. I resent my abusive upbringing, but I like to think I turned out okay, and I know what I don't wanna do when/if I become a parent, it made me strong, and i cant change it now so i choose not to get too cut up about it. I work with kids day to day and I look at them and it makes me weep thinking what kind of demons someone must have to want to hurt anyone, let alone defenceless children. That makes me angry. But having seen the substance side of things, and having my own mental health issues, I understand how hard life can be on that side. Death was a mercy for her.  I'm sorry life wasn't easier, mum, but I'm glad I didn't go down with you, and I'm grateful for the life you birthed.",

He will use any situation to ask for money or try to turn it to make him have the advantage, very reminiscent of addict behavior. Those times are hard to remember whether I‚Äôve forgiven him or not..\n\nI‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs clean, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs doing better, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs a positive part of my kid‚Äôs lives but I am still bitter about the time lost, still angry that I didn‚Äôt have him when I needed a father.\n\nI guess I‚Äôm still resentful, in some ways‚Ä¶",

But he never really repaired with me - he has never really grasped what it was like for me to grow up with an unpredictable alcoholic father in the home. At the same time, he‚Äôs not a bad person and his intentions are good (if selfish), so as an adult I have not cut him out of my life. I see him every few months and encourage a relationship with my kid. Unfortunately, my kid kinda picks up on the weirdness between us so they don‚Äôt have the closest grandparent/grandchild relationship. It makes me sad. I do love parts of my dad and I have some decent memories of times when he wasn‚Äôt drunk and he really loved me. He‚Äôs nearing 70 now and I wonder what the end of his life will be like, and whether I‚Äôll regret not trying harder. I know it‚Äôs on him to do the work, but I also know that he‚Äôs emotionally stunted and always will be, so if I want a closer relationship then I‚Äôm going to have to do a lot of the labor to make it happen.",

   "message": "No. My father started on the road to recovery and right after his first year of sobriety he started dating a girl only 3 years older than me which was uncomfortable to say the least. He was 42, she was 22 at the time. Even after I put that aside and got busy during university my Father never told me about my grandfathers health, how he had a tumour and was going through chemo. My grandfather passed away suddenly and my Father still didn‚Äôt tell me when the funeral was. \n\nI only found out by sending my condolences to a family member and they asked me if I would be at the funeral the next morning. His excuse was he was trying to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me when i‚Äôm a full grown adult and throughout my entire childhood never tried to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me from his alcoholic-induced rage fits every night and the trauma that put me through. \n\nHe started drinking again ‚Äúcasually‚Äù so he says, only a few months after dating his girlfriend. Which was the dealbreaker for me among other things. \n\nHe abused a substance and in my opinion has had no right to use it again without judgment. As well as having next to no improvement in maturity.\n\nEdit** Forgot to mention he never completed one of the steps in the 12-step program in which you apologize to those you‚Äôve affected in your life.
