If your lady thinks she may have started her cycle early, and comes back like: \"False alarm.\" That's usually what it is, and I'd suggest wearing a condom cause her chances of getting pregnant are much higher. Also, vaginal discharge is so acidic that it can leave what looks like bleach stains on your underwear. (If you ever see what looks like bleach stains on navy blue, dark blue, or black underwear, it is usually from the acidic vaginal discharge interacting with the fabric dye.)\n\n\nEdit: Yes, you should always wear a condom to help prevent pregnancy. Sperm can survive up to 5 days in the woman's body.",

   "message": "I don‚Äôt know if these are ‚Äúfun‚Äù facts but I do wish more men were aware of them: (and I just want to preface this by saying to all the men out there that this isn‚Äôt  meant to be a negative post against men. I know and love so many good men! This is more just things I‚Äôve noticed or that have surprised me over the years that I just thought everyone knew). \n\n1) often, turning a woman on has more to do with you making her feel emotionally safe and respected, and as if she‚Äôs the sexiest woman on earth and you just desire her so much. It‚Äôs more about building these ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù rather than how you flick her clit (I mean that might help too but it‚Äôs not the deciding factor on how good the sex was). \n\n2) pregnancy and birth can be excruciatingly painful. Her skeletal structure and internal organs are literally moved and shifted into different places. Imagine someone prying your hip bones apart slowly every day and then shoving a small watermelon up your ass. So when the doctor says she needs MINIMUM 6 weeks of recovery/no sex, you listen and don‚Äôt pester her. Help her with stuff, even if it‚Äôs stuff she normally would do. \n\n3) again, pregnancy and giving birth and then looking after a baby is extremely exhausting and emotional. I know it might look like she‚Äôs sitting on the couch chilling while the baby breast feeds, but breast feeding actually increases hormones in her body that make her feel even more tired and hungry than she already is. Just try to remember that at any time you feel exhausted being a new dad, she‚Äôs probably feeling that times 10, especially if she has had to return to work within the first year. \n\n4) women have three holes in their genital area. One for poo, one for wee, one for babies/periods. I know this might sound weird to some of you, but I know of many men in some countries that do not know this. \n\n5) squirting is literally a mixture of vaginal mucous and urine. (Edited after someone gave me a little perspective). \n\n6) porn is not real. You 100% need to ask your partner before you do anal, choke them, slap them or any other stuff that‚Äôs not basic missionary. Usually people in healthy relationships will talk about their limits and curiosities or fetishes or things they want to try, so I am not directing this at all men. It‚Äôs just something I think everyone should be more considerate about when they have a sexual partner. \n\n7) periods are not something a woman can ‚Äúfeel coming on‚Äù or ‚Äúhold in‚Äù. She also doesn‚Äôt get to pick which days it happens. It‚Äôs not like going to the toilet. It‚Äôs literally like if you cut yourself and blood flows out, you can‚Äôt ‚Äúhold it in‚Äù. We can track the days it usually happens and notice the pattern so we can get a rough idea of when it will happen again and for how long, it it‚Äôs not always ‚Äúon time‚Äù and sometimes we can get a surprise early start. \n\n8) biologically a woman‚Äôs body doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdecide‚Äù to abort a baby if she‚Äôs been raped. It also doesnt decide to get pregnant. Its not a decision making process that the body goes through to decide whether or not to ‚Äúallow‚Äù sperm to enter the egg. Where this idea came from, I do not know, but it‚Äôs wrong.\n\n9) in healthy men and women, women genetically have a higher body fat percentage (this has to do with evolutionary changes over time) and fat is also distributed differently in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs bodies. Higher testosterone also makes it easier to lose fat and gain muscle. Higher estrogen is generally associated with voluptuous figures (big boobs and butt). \n\nSo if you‚Äôre a man who thinks that it‚Äôs easy for your female partner to hit the gym and lose her post baby-weight, it‚Äôs really not. Stress hormones also affect the rate at which a person can get rid of fat, or retain fat. Pregnancy hormones can make women feel soooooo hungry all the time. \n\nAll I‚Äôm saying is, just because a woman has more fat on her body than you, doesn‚Äôt mean she is lazy or undisciplined (I mean, she might be, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the default assumption).",
