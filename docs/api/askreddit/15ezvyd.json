This is a medical emergency and you should go to an emergency department right away or you risk losing your penis.\n\nCauses include medication reaction/side effect to certain medications such as viagra, cialis, or Levitra, but also some lesser known medications not prescribed for erectile dysfunction such as trazodone. Other causes can include recreational drugs such as cocaine, spinal cord injuries/lesions, or certain scorpion stings.\n\nThe treatment usually involves sticking a needle into the penis and aspirating the blood out.",
