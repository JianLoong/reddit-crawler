She said something about how it would get worse‚Ä¶.blah, blah, blah‚Ä¶.. then the next contraction registers on the machine and she watched the intensity go up and up and up. She was flabbergasted. I just looked at her right through the contraction, calm as a cucumber, and told her you can get used to a lot of pain when you have to endure it for years on end. She said ‚ÄúI never knew.‚Äù  I said she did but didn‚Äôt believe me because it was not her own experience. She now laments at how awful my periods were and there was just nothing she could do to help. Eye-roll. Anyhooo‚Ä¶.. about 40 hours later that kid was cut out of me as I never dilated a centimeter.",

I mean, sometimes splattering bathroom stall walls with blood when changing mega-tampons plus full size pads hourly.\n\nLast year I had a water ablation to stop post menopausal bleeding. When I found out more about ablation, how effective it is at reducing excessive bleeding, and how long it‚Äôs been around, I was so angry. WHY had NO doctor ever offered this to me? Why do doctors let us suffer without giving us options? \n\nI‚Äôve always been super vocal and open with doctors, but I‚Äôm not a specialist. People complain about drug commercials on tv in the US, but at least some people find out that new treatments happen every day.",

It's called PMS for a reason. The \"P\" stands for \"pre\". Once my menstruation starts, it's a relief. Yes, there are other symptoms then, but the irritability disappears.
