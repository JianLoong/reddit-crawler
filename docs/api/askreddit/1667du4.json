Someone I know seemed emotionally vulnerable and deeply sensitive, but after years it became apparent that only his own problems mattered to him… he’d dismiss anyone else’s struggles in an instant. He truly crossed the line when he casually dismissed his friend’s legitimate suicide attempt because he felt it paled in comparison to his own recent break up (of a month long relationship). I don’t understand how anyone who claims to go through so much suffering cannot empathise with those in similar or worse struggles. It feels so horrible to treat suffering as a ‘dick measuring contest’ where you get jealous and dismissive of somebody has it worse that you.",

Sometimes, they will point out things that you weren't even insecure about to begin with and make you conscious about it. \n5. They blame their shitty behaviour on alcohol or being drunk. Imo, that is when a person is most honest.\n6. They say sorry just to get you and the benefits they received from you, back into their life. The apology doesn't come from a place of understanding that they hurt you or did something wrong. \n7.

Not even like one more dollar per hour for some guys who had worked for him for years. One employee asked him if he would be willing to get some Thanksgiving turkeys for his undocumented and very poor employees and he said no because they'll expect it every year. \n\nI'm a thrifty person but I'm not cheap. I'll never forget that shitty person and disgusting level of greed and gluttony",
