They had great parents and they accepted me as their another member of the family. Daughters would make me take them places, never give for gas, go after any man I appeared to be interested in. I literally told one sister while I was picking her up that night to bring her where I was hanging out that I had a HUGE crush on the guy and she was making out with him not even 2 hours later. When I would put my foot down and say no. Say I don’t have the gas, I have things to do already planned, I was being “self absorbed.” \n\nLet one of the sisters be my roommate when I hit my own place. She couldn’t hold down a job, brought strange men home in the middle of the night while I was sleeping and wake up to find them in my bathroom or kitchen. Adopted a cat but never got it spayed and the kitty ruined my furniture by spraying all over my sectional sofa. Had to be thrown out. She wound up getting pregnant and left with no bills paid the prior month. I paid all for the month. Told her whatever, that’s your baby shower gift to just let it go. \n\nLast straw was when the other sister tricked me into being a ride for her to get an abortion telling me one thing (she just didn’t se it in her being a mom or whatever and cried) turned out the guy she was with found out she cheated on him and told her to get an abortion or he’d leave her. Her choice but straight lied to me. I stopped all contact with both after that and from what I hear I’m glad I did. Their life is a crazy, drama roller coaster even in early 40’s that I’m glad I didn’t have to endure after the age of 25.",

   "message": "This was a high school experience, I dont know really think adults act in the same way (or I'd like to hope) but my best friend and I have always been inseparable. We typically didn't care for interacting with others too but that's bc we were both socially anxious with trust issues. We'd been best friends for about 8 years at this point.\n\nAnyways one time there was this girl that started to get close to my best friend. I trusted my best friends judgment obviously so we all 3 hung out a fair ammount in school. However I started to notice really quickly that she only would hang out with my bestie (I'll just start calling her amy) whenever her cooler \"friends\" weren't around.\n\nThere were a few times her cool \"friends\" (they didn't enjoy her being around but she followed them around like a puppy dog under the impression they liked her) would walk by then suddenly she'd find an excuse to leave and start following them instead.\nShe also would act shy and embarrassed whenever her cooler friends would walk by if she was sat with us and if we tried to talk to her while she was with those people, she'd act really stand offish and quiet. Like she was embarrassed. \n\nThen as soon as we were in classes together again and she didn't really have any else to talk to, she'd act super chummy with us again \n\nAnyways I got tired of her really quickly but Amy has  always tried to see the better in people alot more often than I ever could, so she still hung out with us for a bit after that, and I let her purely for Amy's sake. I didn't care for her but Amy is my best friend and I wasn't going to give up on her for being a nice person. It's not like she ever abandoned me or chose that wanna be cool girl over me , so it didn't really affect me a whole lot. She didn't actively invite her to hang out but also wouldn't tell her to bugger of if she wanted somewhere to hang out either, I feel thats fair. \n\nWe still talk about her sometimes and she's defintely realized now after growing up more that the other girl wasn't good for her or either of us and she doesn't put up with that behavior from anyone else anymore either. \n\nAnother friend type I don't like, are the ones who absolutely adore attention. We weren't exactly besties with this girl but she put herself around us sometimes bc she didn't understand the concept of personal space and just assumed everyone liked her.\nShe used to make up the worse lies and stories , then break down super emotional in front of everybody, then get upset when people would ask her if she was ok or shout at them for \"being nosey\" even though she literally chose to broadcast to EVERYONE whatever it was she chose to talk about that day. \nIt got very tiring hearing her beg for attention basically and then get upset when she would get the very attention she asked for,  or be called out for doing it. \n\nI'd love to go back to high school, I've always loved learning and if not for the people, I'd have enjoyed and appreciated high school a whole lot more.\n\nBestie and I have been going strong for 15 years now btw 💛",

They're the kind of person that would interrupt you telling them that you're upset because someone passed away to rant to you about their terrible day at work. Hell, I'd take a friend that lives on my couch and eats all of my snacks, but is there for me when I need them over the otherwise respectable friend that doesn't listen when you need to have a rough conversation.",

So I had a really great holiday (we were down in Cornwall during the summer, it was absolutely lovely), but my 'friend' had messaged me on discord in the middle of the holidays, and I of course hadn't replied since I was a few hundred miles away and wasn't going online, but they didn't let me know they had any issues with we met up with the rest of the group we used to hang out with to go out to a park, and decided to spring it on me then, and basically manipulate everyone else into kicking me out of the group, and this was after a rough breakup, and already struggling with mental health, so I pretty much lost it and broke down there, and they said in front of me to everyone else, that I shouldn't cry for sympathy, because it's manipulative\nNeedless to say we haven't talked since",
