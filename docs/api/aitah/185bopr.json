 "selftext": "Im 25 F my daughter is 4 F. My daughter L was sitting with me her dad and her baby brother on the couch this was on thanksgiving my sister in law came over with her kids and husband. She walked through the door and asked my daughter for a hug. L walked over to her and stopped dead n her tracks before saying \"you smell\" i corrected my daughter and told her that wasnt nice and she should apologize my daughter proceeded to say \"but mommy she smells like fish\" my sister in law got angry and started yelling at MY daughter about how she was being disrespectful. My daughter started crying and i started yelling at my sister in law that she had no right to yell at my kids and that she shouldve talked to me about the issue instead of yelling at her she proceeded to say \"she should be punished for what she said\" i told her i would not punish my child for saying what she did instead i would talk to her about her actions. She then left taking her kids and called me a crazy b*tch for not wanting to punish my child. My side of the family are saying that im not in the wrong but my sister in laws side is saying that i shouldve punished her for her actions. Aita?",
