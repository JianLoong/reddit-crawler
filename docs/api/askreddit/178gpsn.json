This year.\n\nI've lost enough muscle tone that I became more likely to drop my motorcycle while maneuvering it in a parking lot (mostly due to my missing sense of balance), and it's getting more difficult to pick up six hundred pounds. I sold it and bought a sidecar rig. I'm wondering how well the telelever will stand up to flying the car.\n\nI've been putting off cleaning the gutters because it's gross and messy. Then I climbed up on to the roof, and decided my bones are likely too fragile to be sitting on the edge of a roof digging with a trowel. I can still use my chain saw and electric pruning saw to cut back overhanging branches, but for the first time in my life I paid to have my gutters cleaned.\n\nOther than that, I just feel \"me\". I can still fell and buck unwanted trees and plant wanted ones, and mount/dismount the several hundred pound attachments on our tractor. \n\nI still do stuff with friends and travel about as much as I used to. It likely helps that I've never been particularly attractive but I've always been surprisingly charming, so it never felt like I'd dropped off anybody's radar.",

So we drove up there, and as she was with the family talking, I wandered around the farm, chasing chickens and generally exploring. I had never been on a working farm before. \nI found an old car (a Hudson, I still remember) out behind a barn, way away from anyone, and jumped in to play. After pretending to drive for a few minutes, I realized how hot it was getting. I reached down to open the door, and all the door handles and window cranks were missing.\nI panicked for about a half of a second, then this calmness came over me, and I suddenly felt old. Really old. With knowledge about things I didn't know before. I knew how to fix the car, what parts to look for and how to put them all together. I easily fixed the door, got out, and calmly walked back to the house. Since that day, I have had the amazing ability to fix just about anything, and feel ancient.",
