There's a lot more good than bad on the whole, setting several small goals that you can work on, so if you don't succeed at the same rate in one, you always have your other ones to complete. I also have an attitude that no one is going to bring me down or give someone, be it a boss, or whomever, to have that much control over my time or life. You take time to be with your friends, spouse, partner, and really enjoy the time with them. But there will be times that stress and anxiety may temporarily get the best of you, so get help from a therapist or doctor. When you're down, the only place to go is up, no sense wallowing in misery, that's a waste of time.",
