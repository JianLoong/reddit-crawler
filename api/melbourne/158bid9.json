A task wasn't explained to me properly and I followed the written instructions to a tee, and it turns out those instructions were wrong. I can't get in any real trouble as I was just following instructions but I should have questioned them and it's made me look really stupid to senior management who have had some kind of closed door discussion about me.\n\nI'm sure it'll blow over as it's not catastrophic, but it's going to be a real shit rest of the day.",
