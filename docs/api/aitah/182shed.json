 "selftext": "Me and my gf are in relationship for 2 years now and it was going smooth until yesterday. My gf wanted to explore her sexuality so she wanted to introduce another partner in the bed to spice things up. I said it's not possible for me because I want to be monogamous and I expect her to be too. This was already discussed at the start of our relationship and she agreed to be monogamous back then but when I mentioned this to her she said things change so she can't do anything about it, I thought it was fair that she wanted to explore but I wanna stay monogamous( I'm not religious or anything and there's nothing wrong with polyamory but it's just not for me ). Then she called me a sexist, misogynist and insecure because she thinks I'm limiting her autonomy. Am I a misogynist?  \n\n\nEdit: I broke up with her on the phone. It was hard but it had to be done. I don't think we'd both be happy if we continued this relationship. Thank you all for the advices and support, it really means a lot in these times.",
