 "title": "AITA for \"leaving\" my boyfriend's family without a turkey on Thanksgiving by not showing up?",
 "selftext": "\r  \nEnglish is not my first language. I(F38) broke up with my boyfriend Joey (40M) because I feel lonely within the relationship. He makes zero effort to help me feel appreciated and I‚Äôve had 2 situations in which I‚Äôve realized that he doesn‚Äôt see me as a priority. \r  \n\r  \nThe first one was that I have anxiety and closed spaces make me really nervous. I was in a stressful situation and that obviously spiked my uneasiness when I had to enter an enclosed area. Of course, I could leave but I needed to complete a procedure, so I had to stay. Because I‚Äôve always been there for Joey, I felt comfortable texting him and letting him know how I felt. He didn‚Äôt reply until 3 hours later and simply said ‚Äúof shit! Just scream and cry until your fit is over with‚Äù. I was very confused by the fact that once we talked, he said he was busy and never addressed what happened. \r  \n\r  \nSecond, my family sold two buildings that were a burden. I took on the responsibility of emptying both properties, unwinding my parents' business, helping them move out of town, getting everyone a health plan, etc, while they focused on other things that needed their attention. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù, but it is time consuming. So, I dealt with my career, my kids and with people hiring cleaning companies or someone to help empty out the properties. It took me almost a year, and never once did he offer to keep me company. Info: one of the buildings is in a secluded area and driving away at night could be kind of scary. I enabled a small living space to sleep over if it gets too late to drive home while I straighten things out. I‚Äôll admit that the area isn‚Äôt picture perfect, but it has utilities, some furniture and kitchen and bedroom basics. Of all the things he could have said, he called my place ‚Äúugly‚Äù and ‚Äútacky‚Äù and ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, immediately commenting that he could never bring friends over. I was very hurt but didn't say anything until sometime later. His answer was more a justification than an apology.\r  \n\r  \nI had my space professionally cleaned but the floors are stained, and investing wasn‚Äôt an option. \r  \nI made time for us, listened to his work-related problems, but wasn‚Äôt taken out on dates or allowed to tell him when I was feeling less than happy with my health. His response was to criticize my family, despite me opening up about my reasons to help them with their burdens. This is where I began to dislike him as a person, and I told him since all he talked about was that he expected me to get a ‚Äúcut‚Äù from the sales of the properties. \r  \n\r  \nWe had planned a Thanksgiving dinner with his family. I said I would join but only after I spent time with my kids and my family. My kids would spend the night with my parents so that they could spend more time with my sister‚Äôs children, so I would get back home after dinner with Joey‚Äôs family.  I would go see Joey at night for his family‚Äôs dinner (my family always serves turkey by lunch time). I agreed to bring the soda and fricassee turkey (his family is big), but he asked me to bring some alcohol and bring the soda. This was one week before the event.\r  \n\r  \nI‚Äôm on my way and he called asking me to bring a pie from the pastry shop. I was mortified that he already checked that it was open, and I felt pressured. Then he asked me to bring a few bottles of a specific wine. Honestly. I‚Äôm noticing that I‚Äôm already over $280 which I consider to be a lot for a guest. He called again and I called him out and mentioned that I had made some seat placement ornaments and would love to have a chance to sit down and write each person‚Äôs names. He broke my heart when he said, ‚Äúoh no‚Äù and scorned my gift for being ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù and that he meant no offense but in other words, he preferred his family get commercial ornaments. Info: I own a very small online shop. I sell these things. They were handmade for his family and could be used as a Xmas ornament. I know maybe I was wrong, but I exploded. He didn‚Äôt pay for anything that I was bringing and was insulting me. I immediately turned around and told him I wasn‚Äôt going. I was too embarrassed to tell my family, so I ended up donating the turkey and the pie. I broke up with him, nevertheless. He said I left his family without a turkey. I honestly find it very hard to believe that his family would rely on a newcomer for their entire Thanksgiving dinner. \r  \n\r  \nThis morning, I told him that I can‚Äôt be with him, and the fact that he‚Äôs so preoccupied with my family shows his parents did a very poor job raising him.  I‚Äôve noticed that he wants to give to his family but resents me and other exes for taking care of their own. Also, he‚Äôs of no help and while I‚Äôm hurt, I‚Äôve decided that he‚Äôs not up to my level of dedication so please never call me again. His friends have tried to contact me, but I‚Äôve blocked them. Now I‚Äôm a bit surprised at what I did and I‚Äôm wondering if I was too harsh. AITA?\r  \n",
