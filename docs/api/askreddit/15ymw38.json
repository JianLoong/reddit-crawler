It would increase the bank balance, but make absolutely no difference to how I live or what I spend. Add another zero, and I'd consider not grinding out the last five years to retirement.",

For me I'd sleep well for a multitude of reasons:\n\nI could afford to pay off my roughly 4k of debt.\nI could restore my pet's insurance which has lapsed.\nI could rent my own place and have a savings buffer, letting me escape my abusive family.\nI could pay for a few private health tests to get the medication I need to improve my ability to work, meaning I could achieve financial independence among other improvements.\n\nMoney doesn't buy happiness, literally, but it sure as heck helps you get there...",
