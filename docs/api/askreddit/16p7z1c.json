That song started getting a ton of radio play when I was a teenager and having to come to terms with the fact that I was not like everyone else and would not be able to have some of the things one is taught to want in life.  It was the start of a very dark time, I was depressed for years, etc, and that song kind of became emblematic of that pain.  I'm in my 50s now and even though I have long since come to terms with myself and my life I still can't listen to that song without bawling my eyes out because it reminds me so strongly of the bad times.",

The work/obsession is seriously affecting my marriage. \n\nMy wife and I danced to Unchained Melody as ‚Äúfirst dance at our wedding.\n\nTuff to put into worlds how the combo of it and the video footage of the game which I captured and edited makes me feel, suffice to say it took a song that already ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù me every time up by like 100x\n\nBased on the reaction my video got on the socials I posted to, people just didn‚Äôt get it, No matter.  I unintentionally tapped into something I was feeling in my involvement in the game and I am changing course.   \n\n‚ÄúYosp‚Äù aka Shuhei Yoshida(Great Guy)from PlayStation got something from it anyways lol. \n\nGod Bless",
