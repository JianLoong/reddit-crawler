 "selftext": "My birthday was yesterday and we were traveling home from visiting family for Thanksgiving. It was a long day of travel with 2 young children so it was inevitably going to be a chaotic day. My husband and I are arguing because I'm disappointed that he didn't do anything to make my birthday special. In my opinion he could've had my daughter make me a birthday card (which I specifically asked him to do) or could've picked up a baked good at the airport or other small gestures to make me feel special. In addition when we got home, he went straight to our bedroom to play video games and go to bed. He thinks I'm being childish for being upset because it's unreasonable to expect a travel day to be made special. ",
