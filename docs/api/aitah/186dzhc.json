 "title": "AITAH for being upset about my husbands sexual fantasy?",
 "selftext": "Just to get to the point my (34f) husband (28m) were chatting and the subject about our sexual fantasies came up. I was very hesitant to tell him mine but he insisted. I told him my fantasy was to have a threesome with me and two bisexual men. Even before I met him I‚Äôve always had this fantasy. I‚Äôve had the opportunities to act upon them but never had the courage. My husband seemed put off but said it would never happen. He‚Äôs Muslim and though he doesn‚Äôt mind the gay community it‚Äôs not his cup of tea. I‚Äôm sure you get it. \n\nI then m asked him his fantasy, which he replied he doesn‚Äôt really have one. We left it at that. \n\nToday the subject came up again, I joked with him and said he thinks different of me because of my weird fantasy. He then says to me he does have a fantasy and it‚Äôs to film him fucking his uncles wife. I was like wow. I was really upset. I‚Äôm unsure why I feel this way. \n\nI haven‚Äôt been ignoring him but he knows I‚Äôm upset. He apologized and said he‚Äôd never bring it up again but it‚Äôs too late.  I feel like if the opportunity presented itself he‚Äôd do it since it‚Äôs someone he knows. I know it‚Äôs a fantasy but like am I wrong? I just feel put off. It‚Äôs like me having a fantasy of fucking my sisters husband. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be upset. \n\nCan anyone help me out here and just change my mind? Thanks.",

Could it be more about doing something he isn‚Äôt supposed and potentially getting caught. Or having an audience.\n\nIs it about having power over his uncle or taking something from another man?
