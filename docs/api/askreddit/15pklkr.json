   "message": "So, one serious response amongst the (solid) comedy - in a decade plus of working with kids (and older students with disabilities), weight coming up is usually inevitable. But I actually really appreciate the opportunity to discuss body differences in a neutral \u0026amp; informative way, because I feel like it both satisfies curiosity and destigmatizes the conversation (and, hopefully, teaches them a lesson before they can insult someone with less capacity for that conversation).\n\nSo when I inevitably get a ‚Äúyour belly is big!‚Äù, I respond ‚Äúand your belly is little, and both of those things are okay!‚Äù If they‚Äôre young, we usually move on/leave it at that, but I am sure to frame the messaging consistently if it comes back up - point out other elements of people‚Äôs bodies that are different, that they don‚Äôt make us better or worse, and in the case of perseverating/thinking of it negatively (you‚Äôd be surprised how early fat is demonized), I‚Äôll say something like, ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm also kind and funny and smart, so I focus on those things, which are more important than what I look like.‚Äù Or even pointing out neutral positives, like ‚Äúmy belly protects my organs‚Äù and ‚Äúmy belly is soft to hug‚Äù. \n\nWhen it‚Äôs an older student or a more insulting comment (ie ‚Äúyou need to lose more weight there‚Äù - a comment from a middle school boy on the autism spectrum) I am usually frank and say ‚Äúthat could be true, but my body is my business and it doesn‚Äôt make people feel good to talk about their bodies‚Äù. When he then proclaimed ‚ÄúBUT I JUST WANNA KNOW HOW YOU GOT SO FAT‚Äù üòÇ I said ‚Äúyeah, see, that‚Äôs something that could hurt someone‚Äôs feelings! Even if it‚Äôs just a sincere question, that‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre owed an answer to.‚Äù When we‚Äôve established what is and isn‚Äôt appropriate, I will typically give a scientific answer to the age level - about how fat is a substance that is present in all bodies, but shows up differently on people depending on MANY factors, not all of which we are in control of. And then we come back to only talking to people about things they CAN control, and trying to lean positive - as in, ‚ÄúI really like that dress!‚Äù or ‚Äúyou drew a great picture‚Äù instead of commenting, good or bad, on appearances or feelings.\n\nNot anything any insulter deserves the energy and effort for, but hopefully some body-neutral baby steps in moving towards less insulters in the first place!",
