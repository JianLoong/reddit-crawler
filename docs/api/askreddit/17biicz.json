In theory, it means you can easily find more shows that you like.\n\nIn practice, the lack of diverse content shunts you into very narrow categories of interest, so you get bored more easily and it actually becomes more difficult to find things you like.  It's like eating your favorite food every day for dinner.  It'll quickly stop being your favorite food.",

It's such a bad idea, obviously because it can be difficult to get to know someone well enough in such a short amount of time. For context, I have been with my girlfriend for 8 months and we still haven't moved in together, which is normal, right? I wouldn't know for sure, since I'm so immersed in queer women's culture. We don't plan on moving in until at least a year from now, partially because we want to move out of state after she gets gender affirming surgery in late 2024 (we are both transgender women).
