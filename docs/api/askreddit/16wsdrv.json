The exact boundaries of a middle-class income vary by family size and location, due to the geographical differences in cost of living. That works out to an annual income between $52,000 and $156,000 for a three-person household, as of 2020.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middle-class.asp\n\n\nCharacteristics of middle class:\n\n1. You have an affordable mortgage.\n2. You can afford groceries, car payment, etc.\n3. You are saving for retirement. \n4. You have discretionary spending (although small)\n\n\nI think the problem we are seeing is the shrinking middle class and people who got pushed out of the middle class into the working class wishfully thinking (and voting) with the idea they are still middle class.",
