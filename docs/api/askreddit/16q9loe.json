Now I‚Äôm 36 and yesterday a bar owner yelled at me when I entered because he thought I was a teenager.  Today security tried to kick me out of a casino for being under 21.  Ppl need glasses or to stay out of the sun more.  Anyway my point is that I think how you live your life and take care of yourself can change when you reach a certain life stage.  For official definitions of middle aged I‚Äôve seen sources say everything from 30-45 as the start and 50-67 at the end.",
