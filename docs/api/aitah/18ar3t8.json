 "title": "AITA for asking my mom‚Äôs BF to not stay over after my baby is born?",
 "selftext": "Hey y'all, so I‚Äôm about to pop at 36 weeks (yay me... and my aching back üòÖ).\n\nHere‚Äôs the sitch: I'm living with my mom, who‚Äôs almost 40yo, and my two lil bros, 5 and 7. My plan was to move out with my fianc√© before our little one arrived, but now it's looking like a summer move at the earliest. I'm not working atm but helping out by babysitting my bros while mom works extra shifts.\n\nNow, mom's BF is pretty chill. He's over a lot, like all weekends and some weekdays too. Here's the thing ‚Äì his smell is seriously messing with me these days (pregnancy nose is no joke ü§ß), and I kinda feel like it'll be too much when the baby's here. So, I asked mom if he could hit pause on sleepovers for the first few months post-baby. She was kinda understanding at first, but then hit me with the \"if you don't like it, pay your own bills get your own place.\" Ouch, right?\n\nWe ended up in a bit of a shouting match, which I hate, but I just think the tiny apartment's gonna feel even smaller with a newborn, and having extra space (and air) without her BF around would help. It also just seems fair cause I‚Äôm not allowed to have my fianc√© stay over on account of my bros. But she's making it sound like I'm being selfish or something.\n\nI get that it's her house, but it's also about to be my baby's house, and I thought maybe that counted for something? Idk. I don't wanna be a brat about it, but I'm honestly just tryna do what feels right for my baby.\n\nSo, lay it on me ‚Äì AITA here for asking for a little BF-free zone after I give birth?",

   "message": "You think your nose is sensitive now. Wait till your baby starts solid foods. Anything that comes out of your baby's rear end from that point on is going to smell like dumpster garbage that's been marinating in in a dumpster in the sun for 6 weeks and followed with being cooked on a hot tin roof in the blazing summer sun.\n\nWhen this time comes, I hope your mother asks you to stay out of the house for a few months until the baby no longer smells.\n\nYou don't pay money towards rent, utilities, or groceries. Sounds like you are staying there completely free of all responsibility. If you don't want her stinky bf around, put on your big girl panties and go live somewhat else.\n\nEven though you've been watching the other 2 kids, the response from mom about going to live somewhere else tells me that she's not hard pressed on being able to find a sitter if you left. \n\nPlus, I don't think you understand that you babysitting every once in a while when your mom grabs an extra shift probably doesn't even cover the cost of what your equal share in rent would be. Let along cover the cost of your use of gas, electric, water, and the food you consume. \n\nYou're right. It is her house, which you FINANCIALLY do not contribute to. You are completely an entitled gaping AH.",
