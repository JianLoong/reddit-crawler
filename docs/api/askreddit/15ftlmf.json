Then they proceeded to tear the other one in an attempt to fix the first one. My mother remembers two doctors getting into an extremely heated verbal argument over this. Doctor 1 thought he could treat me at the current hospital I was in. Doctor 2 knew that I would die if I wasn’t transferred to a better equipped emergency center. \nThey were in such disagreement that Doctor 2 literally had to sneak me out after Doctor 1’s shift was over. \nObviously it worked. I turned out not just making a full recovery, but I left ALOT of people scratching their heads because my body never developed scar tissue from all of that. My lungs work 100%",

I was climbing up one of the easier walls to take a break from the more difficult ones I had been doing. Unbeknownst to me, about halfway up my climb the person belaying me (holding my rope) had, in a moment of extreme absent-mindedness disconnected from my belaying rope because they got caught up in spotting for a mutual friend on a more difficult climb. All this being unknown to me, when I reached the top I gave the signal that I was coming down and let go of the wall. I think I passed out as soon as I realized what was happening though several friends also remember me shouting \"look out!\". I woke up on the ground and was rushed to the hospital. I was stabilized, and then sent to the big hospital in the region. I spent 2 weeks in ICU and another 6 in regular hospital wards, underwent 5 surgeries and several more weeks of physical therapy. My injuries include, shattered pelvis, shattered left elbow, 2 broken ribs, punctured left lung, lacerated spleen and, permanent nerve damage on my left side chiefly resulting from my shattered pelvis. Extremely fortunately I was not paralyzed and after a long recovery I am now able to lead a normal life with only a few permanent leftovers. Those are, the nerve damage expressing itself as numbness on the back left leg, intermittent feelings of mild electric shocks in my left foot, hypersensitivity in the furthest left portion of my left foot, minor loss of range of motion in my left elbow and an apparent limp when I walk.",

We were expecting President George W. Bush to speak so every single scout and leader marched toward the parade ground to attend. Unfortunately, due to the sheer number of attendees and a heat index that reached upwards of 120°F, water was difficult to obtain until you reached the parade grounds. As such, I became severely dehydrated to the point where I actually stopped sweating. Upon arriving at the parade grounds there were fire trucks spraying us to cool us down. A bit of water from a fire hose landed in my bottle and I saw it foam up. In my delirium I thought they were spraying us with soapy water. The next thing I knew, I was being carried across the grounds by multiple soldiers to a medical field tent. A woman asked me my name and it took me close to two minutes to register her question. From there I was taken to an emergency tent where, after 5 failed attempts to find a vein with a needle for an IV, I was finally able to receive an IV drip. I went through 3 water bags before having to pee. From my experience, nearly dying of dehydration is far from fun.\n\nTLDR: Almost died from dehydration while trying to see George W. Bush speak",

My parents had a wedding to go to a plane flight away. I was twelve but assured them I would be fine in my own.\nWoke up on the couch fully delerious on day two. Looked up at the ceiling. Thought \"That's a long way away\" as in stories above me. Turned to roll off the couch, and the floor looked a hundred feet away. Eventually rational won through and I dropped to the floor. Got up, went to the bathroom. Looked in the mirror. I see my face covered in red spots. I think \"Oh shit, acne has started.\"\nCall my emergency contact in the area. Family friends, they come over. See my condition and try to take my temperature but break the thermometer shaking it out. I'm under six or seven blankets, shaking uncontrollably. They call my parents. I passed out, but remember my dad arriving. He scooped me up without a word and rushed me to the hospital.\nI'm in the emergency room and I am immediately first in line. I don't remember much at this point, a lot of urgent discussion and then they put me in an ice bath with double IVs in my arms. I could barely feel it. That level of delerium is actually pretty comfortable. Woke up a few days later and heard the details.\nI had a temperature of 106 and was severely dehydrated. If I hadn't been brought in when I was I would have died the next day. I was one of only seven cases in the US that year. The entire state of Michigan had to get a booster shot because of me.\n\nAnd the really important thing here is that I had been vaccinated, but the year I got it they later found out it wasn't strong enough so you needed a booster. But we had moved states so my parents never got that notice. If I had the booster, I probably would have had a mild case. Instead it brought me to the verge of death.\nFFS, get your vaccines and vaccinate your kids. The old diseases are deadly diseases.",
