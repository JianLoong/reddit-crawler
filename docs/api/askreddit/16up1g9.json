We spent a few days together. On that first day we spent a lot of time walking around outside just chatting, and at some point we made it back to her house as the sun was going down. There was a thunderstorm in the distance, it was very warm outside, and the sky had changed to it's dark blue hue now that the sun had gone below the horizon. The stars in the sky were just starting to become visible.\n\nShe pulled me to the side of the house before we went in and looked at me in the eyes, I said \"Whats up?\" and she said \"I'm waiting,\" I said \"For what?\" and she replied \"For you to kiss me,\" so I just went for it. The first one was a small peck out of nervousness, but she smiled and pulled me back in and we made out.\n\nWe then went inside, had some dinner, and spent the night on the couch after her parents went to bed. We watched TV, and during commercial breaks we would continue making out.\n\nAhh, that's a good memory.\n\nWe \"dated\" for another year, but I went to visit her a second time and she was a different person. Very withdrawn, didn't want to get close to me, acting like I was infected with something that she didn't want to catch. Turns out her parents didn't like me and had been telling her to breakup with me. So she did, right as I started my 9 hour bus trip home. That was the earliest traumatic experience with a girl I can recall. She's married now nearly 13 years later. Still friends on Steam but we don't talk",

The disturbing part was when we would play \"house\" she would insist we both got naked and she would lay on top of me. As a kid I didn't really think anything of it. But looking back on it as an adult, I can only think that she had to have been sexually assaulted or molested for her to be acting that out on me.

Unsure what I thought then and I don't know what to think now\n\nFirst 'serious relationship' kiss? Eleventh grade. Both 16, met in a theater performance and we ended up dating a week before opening night. People made fun of us sometimes lol",

I eventually fell (it was snowing and slippery) and while I was on my back, he leaned down opposite to me so his forehead was at my chin and kissed me. He was the mischievous kid in the class and did it as a dare, and I liked him so I brushed it off but I still remember being pissed that he stole my first kiss.",

He stalked me for the rest of the year and he did this in front of all of my friend group where no one knew what to do.  The principal said I shouldn't have been asking for it when it was brought up to him that I was being stalked.  My mom decided that both me and my brother would transfer high-schools because of it.  My first kiss was the reason why I transfered schools, learned that being stalked was my fault, and ended up making my younger brother hate me.  \n\nThat 1 year of high-school at a new school was amazing though.",
