But I know your question is aimed toward young people, and the only thing I can come up with is the concept of “free will” combined with Adam Smith’s philosophy that people are self serving beings that work hard to enrich themselves that led to the concept of the free market and capitalism; i (66f) suspect that young people in America believe that they blame themselves for not being “rich and successful “, rather than seeing rising home prices, and stagnant wages as a societal/corporate greed/governmental result. That combined with the looming issue of climate apocalypse and the stark political divide here would demotivate anyone. Maga fear and fury is easy to harness; young people’s unease and ennui is much harder.",
