I was the one with an emergency and was drowsy the whole time, but I remember that at some point a man was wheeled into the room while making throat noises (think the Grudge) and my Mom took my face in her hands and told me, very calmy and without an inch of panic in her voice, to look through the window and tell her what that weird tree was because she'd never seen one like that (she definitely had). I had no idea what was going on so I kept staring at that tree, and then it was my turn so we left the waiting room.\n\nDays later she told me that the man who was wheeled into the room had one of his legs hanging on for dear life and that there was blood everywhere on his pants, but also on his clothes. He was drunk so he probably had a fight. I hope he's okay now. \n\nMy Mom is the best. She was worried and didn't want me to see this. So she took in the sight but protected me from it. Sometimes, I think we don't deserve Moms.",

This was my first experience in a city emergency room and it was much more chaotic than the country ERs (obviously).\n\nHowever, mom and dad needed to speak with the medical professionals without a precocious 11-year-old listening, so my dad instructed me to sit in the waiting/triage area and he vaguely gestured behind me.\n\nI sat down in the red triage area, trying to stay in view of the hallway so my parents could find me, and then looked up to observe my surroundings.\n\nAcross from me was a 30-something man, his swollen face is bloodied as well as his clothing and his entire head is bandaged ‚Äì wrapped tightly around his forehead to the back, and over and under his chin. A rather large butcher knife is protruding from the left side of his head, with the handle pointed straight to the ceiling and the blade edge facing away from me. The knife is firmly wrapped to the side of his head, and I‚Äôm guessing, keeping his ear in place. I can also see fresh blood slowly wicking through the bandages.\n\nThe man is sitting with his legs crossed and is casually reading a magazine. The knife wobbled slightly as he turned his face from page to page and he seemed particularly unconcerned there is a knife stuck in his head. I don‚Äôt recall much thought processes regarding this situation, other than a flood of questions that I was holding back.\n\nDad came around the corner to collect me and followed my fascinated stare, jumped slightly at the sight of the stabbed man and hauled me out of there pretty quick.\n\nThus, my first introduction to a city ER in a sketchy part of town.",

People being hooked up to IVs in the waiting room. \n\nThere was a man who had cancer and was on chemo and immunosuppressants who very obviously had sepsis (blood infection) and the person next to him had covid and was hacking away. The wife of the man with cancer was begging and crying to the nurses to give her husband a room so he wouldn‚Äôt get sick with any other illness due to his immunodeficiency. They said their hands were tied. I waited next to him in the ER for 12 hours. It was absolutely absurd.",

It was awful. I wonder whatever happened to those kids this was like 10 years ago, I hope they are safe now.",

He‚Äôd been working in some old stately home and a suit of armour toppled over and the sword impaled his foot. It was all bandaged up and not obviously bleeding. So he was just sat there, cool as, waiting for his turn, holding this massive sword lodged in his foot.",

   "message": "Like 8 years ago I was dating a guy who had cancer and we were at the hospital trying to get in for his appointment. All the entrances were closed except the door next to the emergency room. The ER had a huge glass wall and you could see straight into the entire thing. We got to the door next to it and saw that the ER and the main entrance and everywhere else was locked because something was happening, there was a group of people also waiting to get in and a bunch of cops standing by all the exits, you had to go in one at a time. So we stood there waiting our turn and staring at the cops in and around the ER through the glass, and they're all staring at the ceiling. One cop has a broom in his hand and he's poking ceiling tiles, they're all crepping around quietly. We were so confused, then out of nowhere there was a huge crash and some yelling, a dudes entire leg fell through one of the ceiling tiles and the tile busted on the floor, the cops were scrambling top speed one jumped on his leg and everything trying to pull him out of the ceiling. They started ripping the tiles off in fron of where the dude was crawling, it looked like something straight out of a cartoon. The actual story ended up being a little sad he had been baker acted and was losing it trying to escape. But damn in the moment, seeing that, you can't help but laugh. We watched as long as we could.  \n\nhttps://www.nwfdailynews.com/story/news/2015/03/02/1-445080/33960135007/",

Apparently it‚Äôs a common tactic. The ER is busy. When it gets to end of their shift the border patrol agents just leave. They can‚Äôt be bothered with overtime to babysit someone. After the agent leaves the border crosser just walks out of the hospital. \n\nThe ER docs said it happens frequently.",
