Their chairman just gave his annual new year's address to all employees and one of the major themes of the message was that as the largest car company in the world, it's easy to keep doing what they're doing that's made them really successful, but they need to focus even more on understanding customers and giving customers what they really want and need, even when that means sacrificing profit.  \n\nThere's also many stories about how the company treats employees extremely well.  He has said many times that he can always count on top company management to do what is right for employees, customers, the environment, and society even when it's not the easy thing to do, and has given some pretty incredible examples over the years.\n\nI know car dealerships are almost universally terrible and that that's the only interaction most people have with someone who \"works for Toyota\" (dealership employees don't actually work for the OEM for most companies, including Toyota), but the company behind designing and building the cars sounds pretty amazing.",

Doctors sit down and talk to you until you are done.  An 30 minute appointment lasts 30 minutes.   They are not incentivized to take more patients.   Every employee is proud of the “Mayo way” and it shows in every interaction from the front door to the doctor’s office.  Best docs, cutting edge medicine with a North Star of patient experience… the Mayo Clinic model of care.  \n\nOne last thing to mention how special the practice is.  The Sisters of St Francis and the original Dr Mayo set up a field hospital after a tornado decimated the town of Rochester, MN.  Soon the sisters opened a hospital, St Mary’s, that Mayo would send his clinic patients too and staff it as well.  As the mayo practice grew to hundreds and thousands of practitioners so did the Nuns hospitals.  Beginning in the mid 1980s discussions began to integrate the two.  Upon both parties deciding to become one entity lawyers were called in.  They asked for previous legal documents on their past relationship… there were none.  For over 100 years the relationship existed with a handshake!!!!   Name a company that has that record?!?",
