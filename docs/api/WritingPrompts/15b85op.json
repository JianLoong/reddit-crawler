   "message": "\"Ahoy, mother fuckers.\"\n\nDesmond Fleck was a bastard. Every person, human or otherwise, who had the displeasure of meeting him knew that statement as fact. Ambassador Fleck was awarded his prestigious position on a technicality. It was an embarrassing bureaucratic loophole that was quickly closed after his appointment, but the damage was done.\n\nEarth's first ambassador to the Galactic Senate would be an asshole.\n\nRee was a Senate ambassador from a small collection of arid worlds in an outer spiral arm of the milky way. He knew Fleck from a parlor game on a space station that went sideways. He was in the room when the now ambassador had stabbed a Grelican royal guard in the groin before soiling himself and falling into a trash shoot. \n\nNow here was that same man, jettisoning himself from a vessel clearly not designed for space travel. The misshapen hunk of steel hurtled uncontrolled past the Senate station. \"Ambassador Fleck, divert course of your... Uh, vessel, immediately!\" Ree could hear the control room chatter. The channel was open. \"Going to be hard to do that from outside the ship, control,\" he responded. \"Also it doesn't have thrusters.\"\n\n\"And it's about to explode.\"\n\nA blinding flash stung the seven eyes of Ree. When his vision recovered, his mandible flung open in shock. A wormhole had opened, and sucked the wreckage of the new ambassadors 'ship' into it. Another, less severe pulse of light erupted from the maw of that great tunnel through space. As quickly as it had appeared, the wormhole was gone. A knocking sound broke his state of shock, and Ree turned to see Desmond Fleck pointing down to the airlock controls. \n\nHe was smiling.\n\n\"Hey, I recognize those eyes. You were there for that game of stabs and shits on Figoro Prime Station. Any Grelicans get in my face, I'm pulling you over to tell them I won fair and square.\"\n\nRee blinked all seven of those eyes, considered ejecting Fleck back into space, then signed, and let him in. \n\n\"Ahoy back at you, mother fucker.\"",

   "message": "No one said the ship has to arrive by its own means, and if there is anything our space program has taught us, it's that a well planned orbital trajectory beats any propulsion method.\n\nYou see, when the Treaty was ratified, the fastest means of propulsion we had were mere sub-relativistic fusion thrusters. They're pretty archaic by today's standards, as they are constrained to orbital mechanics and classical kinetics while in operation.\n\nThey're also pretty frugal in terms of exotic matter and energy consumption, so they can pretty much be bolted onto anything. Though, even if we convince them it's supposed to look like that, the old lady is gonna get torn apart before it leaves the atmosphere anyway.\n\nNow, we lucked out on this one. Apparently it is tradition to hold the next Galactic Senate hearing in the newcomer species's native solar system. Meaning right now, we have an Official Azatoth-class Outpost Station, well, \"stationed\" around Jupiter.\n\nThe one tricky thing is that the ship has to receive as few modifications as possible, and no carrier ship is to be allowed in the orbital vicinity of the station.\n\n\n“Oh yeah, the old lunar railgun trick worked wonders, we're pretty much already there! But like, how did you say we were supposed to _brake_ already?”",

   "message": "The uniformed woman sighed as she looked at the ship, partly proud that the nation she was born in still managed to keep its oldest warship afloat after all these centuries and mostly just daunted by the task given to her directly from the Secretary General.\n\n\"As you may know, we've recently had our application to formally join the Galactic Senate approved. Admiral Pearson, I want you to personally oversee getting our ambassador safely to where he needs to go,\" the man told her before giving what had to be the punchline to a bad joke, \"That means making sure that the oldest vessel we still have in service is spaceworthy and able to withstand gate travel.\"\n\nValerie hesitated before answering. \"Sir, if I remember correctly, the oldest commissioned ship we still have is the USS *Constitution*. It's not made for space travel. Even with the updates and repairs made to it, I barely consider it *sea*worthy.\"\n\nThe Secretary General frowned at that, then looked up what the ship was. He chuckled and shrugged.\n\n\"Well, the text of the treaty we signed is very clear. The ambassador to the Galactic Senate must arrive to their first meeting in the oldest vessel still in the member's service. The USS Constitution certainly qualifies. I'll rubber stamp any funding or requisition requests you have for this project. Earth's standing cannot be placed in jeopardy, Valerie. You know how long we've been working on this.\"\n\nThe admiral sighed deeply as she remembered that conversation and then the follow-up with the American delegate. Earth had finally been united under one flag a century ago but a lot of the old national governments continued since it was deemed easier to keep current bureaucracies largely in place for the most part. What was formerly the United States Navy was now part of United Earth Fleet Command but the USS Constitution wasn't merely an old warship. She was the pride and joy of a nation that still made noises about being relatively independent regardless of the treaties it signed, a powerful symbol of American history and endurance. It had taken weeks of clearing the red tape surrounding it so that she could stand here at Charleston Naval Yard and wonder if maybe she should have gone into the sciences like her mother rather than signing up for military service.\n\n\"Admiral Pearson?\" an unsure voice interrupted Valerie's reverie, calling her attention to the junior officer that came with her. \"Is everything okay?\"\n\n\"Everything's just *peachy fine*, Lieutenant, thank you. Did you track down the ship's captain? I understand I didn't call ahead and he has the day off but this is rather important.\"\n\n\"Yessir. He's on his way here,\" the lieutenant replied quickly, pausing before asking what was on everyone's mind today. \"Are we really going to take the USS Constitution to space?\"\n\n\"It appears so. It's in remarkably good condition, it looks like, at least from where we're standing. What do you think, Lieutenant Hatfield? Can we do it?\" Valerie asked.\n\nHatfield looked at her and then stared at the ship for a long moment before taking a deep breath and answering.\n\n\"It's ... certainly going to be a challenge, sir. It's not going to be as simple as bolting on some metal and rockets and calling it a day.\"\n\n\"Rockets? No, we need to keep it as close to the original as possible. We're going to sail it, of course.\"\n\n\"... Pardon?\"\n\nValerie's only response was to gesture at the ship's topmast, drawing her assistant's eyes to the sails furled up there.",
