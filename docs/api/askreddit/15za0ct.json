His grandfather was French.\n\nI also thought it was off-trend.\n\nApparently, a lot of parents went off-trend that year and some version of that name is VERY common in his age group.  Now, Luc isn't so common, on it's own.  But we definitly ran into the other problem of, being American, people not liking the name Luc. He gets renames Lucas or Lucy (if they don't see the face with the name...and, he's cis so that's not another added complication) all the damn time.\n\nI asked him about it and he says he will generally just roll with it because it's too much trouble.  But sometimes he has fun with it and will tell people:\n\n\"It's L-U-C, Luc...short for Lucifer.\"\n\n\"It's short for Lucid.\"\n\n\"It's short for Lucky!\" (or Luckless)\n\n\"It's short for Lucrative...here's my number.\"\n\nHe's a fun kid.",
