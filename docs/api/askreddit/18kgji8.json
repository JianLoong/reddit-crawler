They don’t say anything because they *know I have literally seen the world is a globe.*\nOne of my favourite stories is that of the flat earther who joined the USN to find ‘evidence’ of the flat earth. He became a navigators yeoman. After a months of painstaking measurements using every tool at his disposal he was forced to admit he was a tool.",
