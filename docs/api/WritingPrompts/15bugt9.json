   "message": "The last time Brad had come close to meeting death was when he was ten. His uncle tried to kill him because he couldn't bear the thought of my father having children while his own were dead. \n\nHe could say that he became a monster because that moment. It would be a lie. Even at ten, he wasn't scared. He was curious. What happens when a person dies? How much pain would he feel? Did the rats he stabbed felt the amount of pain? But his father had saved him. \n\nBully for him. He became Brad's first victim. If he really wanted to live then he wouldn't have killed Brad's mother. His mother was a nice woman. She treated Brad like he was just a child who was curious. She kept his curiosity from getting too out of control. \n\nThen a spree began. It was bullies at first, he should know how annoying bullies were. He was one. \n\nThen one day the killings became too boring. It was the same 'Please don't kill me' and 'I'll do anything' were getting tiresome. They bled the same. They cried the same. They even died the same. \n\nLike he said. Boring. \n\nBrad knew it was time to find a new thing. He was always fascinated with Death and since his father robbed him of that opportunity, he decided to give the law a chance. \n\n*\n\n\"Your death penalty will be pardoned if you spent a night with Inmate 204.\" The officer said. \n\nBrad didn't really want to get his death penalty pardoned but he was intrigued now. And it had been a while since he had been intrigued. \n\n\"Sure.\" He said shrugging. \"How bad can it be?\"\n\nThe officer snorts. \"That's what they all say.\" \n\n*\n\nBrad walked down the isolated corridor. There was nothing but a single bulb that illuminated the area. It was creepy. He loved it. \n\n\"You think you are so different that one night would change nothing. They all thought that too. None of them made it to the morning.\" The guard escorting him said. \n\n\"How many have been there?\" He asked. \n\n\"Too many.\" Then he remembers who he's escorting. \"Not enough.\" \n\nHe rolled his eyes. Brad knew he was a monster but some of the people here were actually good. If he could feel then he would've felt bad for them. \n\nThey stop in front of a severely locked door. He banged his baton against the door. \"Step back.\" \n\nThe guard opened the door and all but shoved him inside. Then closed it. He laughed. He was the worst thing to walk the Earth and the Guard was scared of whatever was in this room? Idiot. \n\n\"Hey.\" A soft voice said. A familiar voice. \n\nHe turned back and looked at the most innocent looking man he had ever seen. He was supposed to be afraid of this? He looked like a man the prison ate up.  \n\nBut why did he sound so familiar? \n\n\"Trying to avoid death row?\" He said. \n\nA shock ran through him. It looked like a man but its voice, he sounded like his mother. His sweet, innocent mother. \n\n\"I'm not avoiding it. I was just curious what was here.\" He said feigning indifference. \n\nThis was obviously some sort of mind game. The prison designed this cell to drive people crazy so that they took their own life. He was too logical to go crazy. \n\n\"Hmm.\" He sat on the cot looking at Brad with his green eyes. \n\nThe same shade as his mother's. \n\nBrad gulped. \"What's your name?\" \n\n\"I have many.\" He shrugged. \"The most common among them is Death.\" \n\nBrad couldn't help it. He laughed. \"Sure you are.\" \n\n\"No one believes me, at first.\" He sighs. \"You will.\" \n\n\"Okay, weirdo. Let us assume you are death then why are you in prison?\" Brad asked. \n\nIf this what everyone faced then he had no idea why everyone died before morning. This was ridiculous. \n\n\"Why do you think this is real?\" He asked instead. \n\nBrad frowned. \"The guard just escorted me here. It's the underground floor of the prison.\" \n\n\"Have you seen the layout of prison?\" \n\nAn image flashed in his mind making him freeze. He looked at the man, his face was unnatural. Yes, he looked innocent but now Brad could see beneath the mask. The darkness that swirled inside him.\n\n\"I have been waiting to meet you since I was ten.\" Brad breathed out. \n\nDeath laughed. The cold sound made a chill run down his spine. \"You thought you waited for me. You got caught because you were bored. You thought meeting death would be as easy as the noose around the neck or an injection.\" \n\nBrad started at him. He had waited to meet death, to know what the life beyond held. \n\n\"But I am going to die.\" He said. It's not a question. He had known this ever since he stood on trial.\n\n\"You think it would be easy?\" Death asked, a small smile playing on his lips. \n\nYes. \"No.\" He lied. \n\n\"You don't have to lie. You think you don't feel.\" Death said stepping closer to me. The stench of decaying bodies makes him want to escape. \"You will feel when I start.\" \n\n\"Start what?\"\n\n\"Your death, of course.\" \n\n\"So, you kill everyone that walked in here?\" \n\nDeath laughed. \"Of course not. I fucked with their head first.\" \n\nBrad felt weirdly proud. \"And you can't fuck with mine.\" \n\n\"Of course, I can.\" Death scoffs. \"I just prefer not to waste my time. I have something special planned for you.\" \n\nBrad felt pressure on his neck like someone was choking him. He looked at Death, who hadn't moved from his place. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" Brad choked out. Tears were rolling down his cheeks. \n\n\"You always tested the best method to kill someone on rats.\" Death smiled cruelly. \"You are my rat.\"\n\n**\n\n[You can find more of my stories at r/iknowthisischeesy]",

Your poor mother, who cried until she fainted in your trial. Do you know how she's doing now?\"\n\n\"S-Stop. Stop it!\"\n\n\"She locked herself in the room all day and night, refusing to eat or drink. She cried and screamed and wished it was all but a bad dream, that her sweet child didn't do anything wrong. Then, one day, she started puking blood and collapsed on the floor. Oh, the unbearable pain is crushing her fragile form. You are killing her from the inside. You did this to your own mother.\"\n\n\"No, you're lying...\"\n\n\"Your mother is becoming a mad woman because of you. You are the one who is causing her all this suffering, you disgraceful scumbag. Your neighbors are avoiding your house like the plague, but they can still hear her screams at midnight, like a mad woman.\"\n\n\"Stop- Stop! I said *STOP!!!*\"\n\nThe yell echoed in the cell room, and I'm sure the guards hear it from outside too. I sit cross-legged on the bench, eyeing the man who had crumbled to the floor, hands holding his head. This man had gotten knocked down to his knees, trembling like a leaf. How cute.\n\n\"People are whispering, you know? They said, 'Look at that old hag, her son is a murderer,' 'He got the death sentence this morning,' 'I'm glad I've kept my kids away from those barbarians.' And your mother heard it all, every single word, and she's at the end of her wits now. Maybe a noose seize tight around the neck wouldn't be so bad.\"\n\n\"Please... stop...\"\n\n\"Relax, pal. It's not even past eight yet,\" I laughed, \"Now, where were we?\"",

   "message": "Long ago, I made a deal with the humans...\n\nAs an immortal shapeshifter, I was feared, and I loved it. Centuries of terrifying screams and wails of despair.\n\nIt lasted only so long, however. One day, I learned that several of my victims would end up in various different states of health, physical *and* mental. All of a sudden, it made sense why some people were trying to find a way to destroy me. The guilt spanning centuries weighed so heavily, my body ached.\n\nI could never be destroyed, but I could no longer live how I had been. The deal was simple: they can contain me in whatever manner they wished, but in return they were to find humans for me to terrify. I knew they'd accept; there are some very vile people out there.\n\nI'm kept in a spacious cell underneath a prison designed to hold the worst of the worst - there were 'death row' inmates, but this particular prison was known as 'death row' prison because if you weren't sentenced to death, you were locked up for life.\n\nEver since I arrived, my hidden corner of the world became a part of the tour, right at the end of it. The inmate would be given a choice: spend one whole night in the same room as me, or their sentence is carried out.\n\nAll the inmate would see is a young-looking girl, about ten years old, smiling sweetly and reading her books. She was always met with sceptical looks, a few 'aww's', but it always led to the same set of questions:\n\n\"Why is such an innocent girl locked away?\"\n\n\"What is she?\"\n\n\"Is this a joke?\"\n\nThe guard would simply shrug and say \"Will you spend a night in the same room as her, or carry out your sentence?\"\n\nSome would catch on that behind those wide, innocent brown eyes, lurks something horrific and would be desperate to get away; others would scoff and say 'that's not even a challenge'. My favourite ones are the ones who are obviously trying to convince themselves that it's just a little girl.\n\nIf an inmate were to accept the conditions, they'd be stripped, put in a straight jacket and chains, and have something placed over their mouth so that the only thing they can do is scream. At this point, some would try to back out, realising something is up, but once the challenge has been accepted, it's too late. Others would buy the explanation that they don't want the inmate to try to hurt the girl.\n\nThat moment when my next victim is locked in with me... I always relish it. My job is to get them to squirm, to scream, to want to beg to be rescued. They only succeed if they make it through the whole night without screaming loud enough for the guards to hear.\n\nOnly two people have made it through the ordeal. Because they were able to avoid screaming, that meant they also had strong wills and minds, and were able to resist any long-term effects. One of them admitted they were scared shitless and thanked me for showing them what kind of monster they were; I took it as a compliment. The other one was on their knees to the guards, sobbing, apologising over and over, promising to **never** cause trouble again.\n\nRight this moment, I'm waiting for another prisoner to make their decision. \"You have a choice: stay in that cell with her for one night, and be granted a pardon... or wait for your turn on death row. Which will it be?\"\n\n\"That tiny little girl? Really?\" He looks at my smiling face. He's an angsty teenage boy who killed his mate in cold blood for harassing his sister. \"I don't know what game you're playing, but I didn't do anything *wrong*. I'll do it.\"\n\nI wait in anticipation as he's being 'prepared'. Once the mouth thing is on, he's shoved roughly into the cell. I can sense his unease already... my grin stretches all the way to my ears...\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThank you for reading!

   "message": "Ah yes, another toy enters the playpen. It was lured in by my smile and a dark deal, one night with me, or the rest of their lives in prison. Personally, I've only ever had one toy pass up the opportunity to play. Of course, I had my favorite toys, those monsters with bad jackets, and little regret. I always got to browse the toys before they came to my door, a booklet on what they had done to get to where they were. Most of them were hand-picked by me.\n\nFirst, it would start off normal. The toys always loved talking about themselves like they were people. I let them talk as much as they liked, most for quite a long time. The toys never knew just how well I knew them. My mouth never moved, but they heard my voice regardless. \n\nThat's when the fun truly begins. The toy would always go to the fountain and get a drink, not knowing what they were consuming. The guards knew not to look into my playpen after the toy began to drink. They'd turn around after satiating their thirst, only to see me as I truly am. \n\nAll my mouths in a lewd smile, all of the pairs of eyes gazing directly into the toy, I'd always ask the toy what's wrong. They'd never get the chance to answer coherently. It's like they've never seen a monster before. \n\nWell, unless they looked in the mirror.",

   "message": "\"One night with a random dude? Easy!\" The guard shook his head as they walked down the corridor towards the elevator. \"You're fucked bro. You have no idea what I'm gonna do when I get out!\" The guard remained stoic as the inmate insulted and threatened him. He knew. He knew exactly what was about to happen. He was just glad it wasn't him. The inmate kept arrogantly talking about how he would get revenge on everyone who put him here. Even as they walked down the darkened corridor. They stopped in front of a concrete door covered by a large steel door. It looked rusted and had no window. Silently the guard turned to him. \"Hands out.\"  The convict smirked as Guard uncuffed him before opening the door. \"Good luck.\" The convict stepped in to the cell. It was illuminated with a single dim lightbulb. From a darkened corner the inmate dwelling within stepped forward. He stood about 5'9 with long worry looking black hair and a Scraggly looking beard. His skin was pale, and his ribs clearly visible beneath his skin as though he'd been down here a while. He had some muscle but was rather scrawny looking. Hardly a threat to anyone. \"You're here to... Be absolved?\" The man asked. The convict smirked. \"That's right toothpick. Let's get one thing clear. You annoy me, and I'm gonna kick your ass, then I'm going to shove your head up your ass, understand?\" The man smiled. \"Perfectly. But you have no power here.\"\n\n\"Don't test me you little-\" The man stepped fully into the light. He wore no shoes but and only a pair of ragged pants. \"Apologies.. My last Guest tore my shirt trying to escape. They haven't given me a new one yet. So.. What are you in for?\" The man held a pleasant smile. \"Killed a cop. Allegedly.\" The man cocked his head a moment before asking. \"Sentence?\" The convict glared at him. \"25 years.\" The man held his pleasant smile. \"A quarter of your life. How long have you been here?\" The convict rolled his shoulders. \"About 4 years now. And I'll be put tomorrow.\" The smile seemed to grow on the man. \"Confidence... I like it. Well let's begin. I too have some ground rules. You can do anything to try to survive. Beat me, stab me, do whatever you feel necessary to survive. Use anything in this room. However, if you fail I will-\" He was cutoff as a fist slammed into his jaw sending him sprawling on the ground. Within seconds the convict was on top of him, raining blows into his face. As another blow landed on the man, the man laughed. The convict sat confused for a moment before a punch from the man sent him flying across the cell. \"Well done! Well done... You understand that I was serious... But now.. It's my turn.\" The convict looked up as the man smiled again, exposing his teeth. Each one slowly began sharpening to a point before his eyes, the mans own eyes getting wilder as he stood motionless. \"What the fuck... What are you?!\" The man laughed crazily as he took a step forward. The convict was quickly to his feet and threw a punch. Within a millisecond the man caught it and with a small twitch a loud crack was heard as pain exploded through his arm. He screamed as he glanced down and saw an obviously broken arm. \"Try again!\" the man crazily laughed as the convict rushed past him and grabbed a wooden chair. With a hard swing it broke over the man's head. The man laughed again before gripping the convict by his neck and lifting him up. The Convict gasped for air before plunging the splintered end of the broken chair leg into the neck of the man. An unholy screech erupted from the Man's mouth as he dropped the convict. Quickly the Convict began pounding on the door. \"Let me out of here you bastards! HEY LET ME OUT! HELP!\" A maniacal chuckle sounded behind him. \"No one is going to let you out until tomorrow...  But..\" The bloodied splintered chair leg dropped at his feet. \"...You won't make it that long.\" A set of sharpened teeth clamped down on his neck as he screamed, then was no more. \n\n\nThe next day the guards opened the cell to find the man sitting in the corner. His musculature far more defined now, his body now had far more weight to it. His skin a healthier tan. His hair now more voluminous. \"He smiled at the guard. Wonderful meal last night. You can take the scraps if you want.\" He motioned to a bloodied tattered prison uniform and a set of bones. The guard shuddered a bit before collecting the remains and stepping to the door. \"See you next month Officer....\"",

   "message": "He couldn't believe the offer was real. \"A single night with a well dressed, friendly looking man? How hard could it be?\" That's what they all think. He agreed to the deal and the guard brought him up to my cell.\n\n\"It does seem a lot creepier coming closer\" the new inmate thought, \"and you can't even see the back of the cell\". I slowly stood up and walked towards them as the guard opened the door. \"Why isn't it locked?\" the inmate thought?\n\n\"Because it's not needed\" I said to him. Confused he looked back, but the guard was already gone. \"What is going on here?\" he mumbled. \"You're here to get what you deserve.\"\n\nThe voice didn't seem to come from anywhere. It just formed in the inmates mind. He spun around, looking directly into my face. I still smiled politely, while my face slowly started to melt. He took a step back, looking at me in horror. \"What's the matter Robert? You seemed to enjoy this sight, when you poured acid over your victims\"\n\n\"Who told you?\" he cried out \"Who told you my real name? Not even the police know my real name!\"\n\n\"Oh, I know so much more, Robert. For instance how you tortured some of your victims, before you finally gave them the killing blow.\"\n\nI laughed as his face grimaced in terror. In the blink of an eye, I burst into a mixture of flesh and blood, completely engulfing him in just a few moments. His screams got soon replaced by the sound of gargling. He fought as hard as he could, but he didn't stand a chance.\n\nJust as he thought it was over, he found himself lying on the floor of a warehouse. He looked around and he seemed to remember this place. This is where he committed his first murder. In the corner of his eyes, he saw a man wearing a hoodie come closer. He recognized the hoodie as well. It was himself. He tried to talk, but the voice was not his own and the man didn't listen anyway\".\n\nWhen the guard arrived at the cell at the next day, I was already up, waiting at the bench, with the same smile as the day before. In the back of the cell, there was a person cowering. The guard almost didn't recognize him. His skin turned pale and his hair turned grey. Big bald spots where visible where he had ripped his own hair out.\n\nA shiver went down the guards spine as he entered the cell to collect the inmate. \"You wont need them.\" I said, as he tried to get his cuffs out.\n\"It's protocol\" the guard said. \"But his soul already left.\" I said, sounding real proud of my work.\n\"What do you mean, his soul left?\" the guard asks.\n\nI smiled. \"Most souls don't come back, after being tortured for eternity!\"\n\n\"For eternity?\" the guard asked confused?\n\n\"Well, I condensed it into a few hours. Nothing you would understand, mortal. Let's just say, everyone gets what they deserve in the end. They don't call me the devil for nothing!\"",
