   "message": "I only sat in a Danish prison, so somethings we can just get out of the way - we pay rent to be in prison in Denmark, and we also have to buy most food. You get a nice enough room ( americans joke that the prison cells would be some big amount in their city ) \n\nYou can have internet, PC - fuck, it must be the Scandinavian prison systems who are playing all those MMOs. Weekly visits. \n\nI just saw today there had been very good results with prisoners training service dogs, from puppy to ready or not. So far they had trained 42, and in all cases there was a calming effect. \n\nIf its a new prison, or recently restaurated - they also have the staffs rights, very much in consideration. And they cant work in a too abusive and loud enviroment, so a lot is done to make sure its peaceful. \n\nThere is so much weed mostly - because they are not so lenient with harder drugs. But they are there, and you basically just illegally order them from the gangs. \n\nWe seperate the gangs - and that causes fuckups sometimes, when something slips and they can get at each other. There is a lot of violence in prison, and there are lot of violent men. \n\nIn sweden they do it differently, and just mix the gangs willy nilly - They have way less fights in prison among gangs than we do. And that is crazy since on the outside its quite the opposite. \n\nAll of these are of course privileges you can have taken from you.\n\nOur jails though - they can be not fit for humans.",
