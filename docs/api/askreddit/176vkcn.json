Friends and family mention my weight completely offhand, and it's destroyed my self-confidence over the years. It's like people don't think you've noticed you're fat, and that they're doing you some favour by telling you.\n3. Height. I'm 6'1, and I've had a lot of women compliment my height even when it's obvious they like nothing else about me. Shorter guys get it BAD from women, to the point where they have to overcompensate in the personality department (hence the 'little man syndrome' thing). I genuinely feel bad for blokes that are 5'8 or below, they get mocked constantly. \n4.  Body hair. Doesn't matter if you can't grow a beard, or a full tache, or if you're thinning/ receding on top, you will get laughed at for it. Hell, I once got stick for having slightly hairy toes! (sorry to all that just grimaced at the thought).",

   "message": "ITT: A bunch of people naming things that are DEFINITELY noticed (like height, dick size, muscles, etc)\n\nFor something unnoticed: hand shakes. This is more common among older guys (like Gen X and Boomers). When they go to shake your hand they make a point of trying to grip as strongly as they can without it looking like they're trying to hurt you. It's a subtle way to point out that they're physically stronger than you.\n\nI'm a tall guy, but I'm very scrawny and lanky. (I'm 37 and have been built this way my whole life.) Most people seeing me on first glance would assume I'm not very strong. They way I talk is also very intentional and technical, which tends to give the impression than I'm nerdy, or not very physical, or weak, etc, insert whatever stereotype you think fits. However, I also work construction. I'm not going to pretend like I'm some super ripped dude, because I'm not, but working in construction you can't help but build some muscles, especially in my hands and arms. And my hands are pretty calloused. So I see it ALL THE TIME when guys in their late 40s-60s who look like they put a lot of personal pride in their physical strength go to shake my hand. They lay on the grip as strong as they can, thinking they are trying to shame me about my size and strength, only to get surprised that I have a pretty strong grip and calloused hands, too.\n\nI benefit from the subversion of expectations, but it's disgusting and toxic that this sort of behavior happens in the first place.",
