There was blood however, it was coming from patients leg apparently. Her leg was broken, and it was in abnormal position.

She asked: \"How does it look?\" and I replied: \"Very bad.\"\n\nWe had no idea how it happened. She was still conscious and not in huge pain. We had problems getting help from the ER or from ambulance. Apparently they didn't think it was that big of priority. When someone did show up.

   "message": "I saw a dog get hit by a car while I was waiting for the bus stop in middle school.  I had noticed two dogs running along the road unsupervised, and I wanted to go to them but they were very big dogs. Plus I was worried if I left the stop, and the driver saw no one there, the bus would just keep going (it had happened before). \n\nSo I watched the two dogs for a little bit until the pit bull got clipped by a car. I still vividly remember him spinning mid air and off to the side of the road. I REALLY wanted to go see if he was okay but it was so far away. The car didn't swerve to try and avoid him or anything, and it didn't even stop. The other dog stood next to his downed friend the whole time.\n\nEventually a lady pulled over, picked up the dog, and put him (and his buddy) in her truck. I hope the dog was okay, but I'll never know. \n\n(I also had unsupervised internet access growing up, but I feel like the dog was worse somehow. Maybe because I blame myself for not stopping it.)",

   "message": "I once saw someone break a bottle of rum on someone else‚Äôs head. The amount of blood that came out was concerning. The guy was fine, but seeing the floor absolutely splashed with blood like some had been murdered was‚Ä¶ traumatic. Like, I legit don‚Äôt know how the guy wasn‚Äôt fainting or something, like, it was so much blood! But no, the guy fought the other guy off, then left the place and called the cops while holding his shirt over his head to stop the blood from going all over him.\n\nGuys‚Ä¶ like, I‚Äôm not kidding, it was a lot of blood. Like‚Ä¶ 16 feet of blood covering the floor. It legit looked like someone had been stabbed or something. And the smell‚Ä¶ ugh, the smell was the worst! It was gross. It didn‚Äôt smell like metal, which is what I would‚Äôve thought it would smell like. Honestly, I haven‚Äôt smelled anything similar since, so I have nothing to give a reference to, but it smelled bad. Not as bad as rotten food or something like that. It wasn‚Äôt as intense, but it did smell bad. Like a lingering medium level fart. But obviously, it didn‚Äôt actually smell like a fart.\n\nYeah, that memory is INGRAINED in my head. Although now that I think of it, the memory has lost some of its definition. Maybe one day I‚Äôll forget about most of it‚Ä¶ I certainly wouldn‚Äôt mind.\n\nAnother terrible thing I witnessed was someone punching one of my parents in the face, and my parent just‚Ä¶ bleeding from the mouth, and I had to get in there and separate them. That was a rough night.\n\nOh! And also, the day my dog (who at that time belonged to the streets) got run over. The way she was sucked in under the tire‚Ä¶ the memory of it makes me wanna cry. She thankfully survived and I picked her up from the streets and took her to a vet. Fast forward a couple days and she was in my home recovering. Then I adopted her. It‚Äôs been like 5 years since and I LOVE that dog. She‚Äôs my baby. She even sleeps in bed with me. She‚Äôs the sweetest.\n\nOh, I also saw a homeless guy that had his face covered in dried up blood. Idk what that was about, and when I first saw him, I thought he was dead, but then he moved a little and I was like ‚Äúoh‚Äù. He seemed to be high or drunk and I was little so I didn‚Äôt approach him to ask if he was ok. I hope he is. I hope he turned his life around. Poor guy.\n\nMan‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen some shit. I mean, maybe not something as horrifying as seeing someone get their head blown off or something, but I think I‚Äôve seen a fair share of fucked up things.",
