If I had time to talk, I'd definitely set up a meeting with a lawyer for acquiring the rights to it legally.\n\n1. Stash it somewhere VERY well hidden for at least a couple weeks. Keep an eye on the news and make sure it wasn't stolen as that would definitely make the news if it was. If it wasn't, I'd just hang on to it for as long as possible. If it ended up stolen and i wanted to keep it, id use these next steps. \n\n2. Melt that fucker down as quick as possible. I'd break it up into smaller pieces and stash them somewhere far enough away along a route I'd normally take through the woods. They would sit there untouched (hopefully) for over a year, at least.\n\n3. Grab gold piece by piece slowly over time, making jewlery and  plain gold rings. I'd put an inscription in it with a very unique name so it wouldnt get flagged with other stolen jewlery. Each piece would be unique as well.\n\n4. Sell a couple pieces just to get enough to travel out of the country and survive for a bit. \n\n5. Ship the rest out of the country in multiple packages using different couriers. They would be sent to a country that don't have extradition laws as well using either a PO box or to a hotel. \n\n6. Get out of the country ASAP and hopefully find a way to sell it there without it getting stolen or getting arrested. I would spend at least the first year learning the norms and staying under the radar. Hopefully by then I find a way to sell it and I contemplate if it was all worth it being able to see family or friends again.",
