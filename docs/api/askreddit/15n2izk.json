My mom would make the most disgusting sauce, it was literally Grey ü§¢ It barely had any taste to it. Biggest reason I despised it was the texture of the noodles, the color and tastelessness of the gravy, and how the beef somehow always ended up tasting like cardboard. \n- meatloaf. Now, sometimes it was bearable. But my mom would experiment with what she could put in it and got pretty wild (in my eyes at least) carrots (I HATE cooked carrots, again texture bleh) one time she tried putting dorritos in it like??? Lots of times she would incorporate random veggies like bell peppers or mushrooms or something I hated so that I would eat it without knowing (cuz u couldnt tell really until it was too late)\n- tuna. Cooked tuna to be exact. I enjoy the tuna u get on sushi but if it's cooked NO0E ü§¢ One time my mom put some in my rice and chicken and I didn't know till after I finished and she told me and I cried for HOURS over her betraying me üòÇ I literally wailed \"YOU BETRAYED ME\" \n- COLESLAW. NEED I SAY MORE. Everything about it icks me. Taste, texture, temperature. The 3 T's of Terribleness.\n- frog eye salad. In theory I should love this dish. It's basically just whip cream, those lil oranges and noodles. The thing that got me was the texture of the frog eye noodles. Can't stand it. Sooooo nasty to me. I'll steal some of it while she's still making it before she adds the noodles. I feel like they're called frog eye noodles bc they secretly are ü§¢\n- And, the all time biggest one, milk. Yup, milk. If I even just see someone drinking it, I will gag. I can't pour it without almost puking. (God forbid I ever have a child üòÇ) it's actually sad how traumatized I am over MILK. I feel like something happened to me when I was little that I completely blocked out bc it was so God AWFUL üòÇ  My mom even says that I used to love it and one day I just refused to even look at it üòÇ Can't watch people drink it, can't pour it, but I can do milkshakes and creamer somehow. when they gave us milk for lunch as a kid I HATED that shit cuz not only do i have to deal with a thing of milk on my tray, I have to watch a whole ass room full of kids DRINK IT. KILL ME ü§¢ü§¢\n\nI've always been picky, but I used to (and sometimes still am lol) INCREDIBLY dramatic about some foods üòÇüòÇ shit used to be END OF THE WORLD if I had to put it in my mouth to the point it was actually traumatizing sometimes üòÇ \nive since gotten better about my pickiness and become less dramatic about food but those are hard HELL NO'S that I will GAG if I think of too much.

   "message": "There is a rumor in my family...my father says it's true, my mother says it's not true. When I was about 4 or 5, my Italian family put a big plate of pasta and tomato sauce infront of me and I didn't eat all of it. They weren't happy that I wouldn't finish my plate, but I simply didn't want anymore. They told me I couldn't leave my seat in the kitchen until I finished my plate. \n\nPerhaps this memory is made up, but a small part of me (thinks) I remember sitting infront of that plate for 4 hours after dinner, with the kitchen lights turned off, everyone else in the livingroom or going to bed. Me sitting there, in the dark, for 4 hours, staring at and smelling cold pasta and tomato sauce, not allowed to get out of my chair, until finally I was allowed to go to bed. \n\nTo this very day, I *despise* tomato sauce and won't eat any food that has even been served with a spoon that previously served tomato sauce. It's like, at the same level as dog poop. In my brain, it's literal poison. \n\nFull disclosure I don't know if this is true or not or I just fucking hate tomato sauce and tomatos.",

I remember it being served to me since I was a kid, one time while I was eating, I reached a breaking point and started crying. My parents knew I disliked this dish, but they would still serve it up a couple days (usually on Wednesdays) every month. My father even yelled at me for crying that one time.\n\nLooking back I feel like they were such assholes about it. I think they saw it as me being ungrateful, but seriously, I just hated the taste of that crap, it's not like it was something I can help. Luckily, nowadays they've learned to let me not eat shit I don't want to eat. They'll still make Zatarain's for themselves, but for me they'll usually whip up a dozen Spanakopitas.",
