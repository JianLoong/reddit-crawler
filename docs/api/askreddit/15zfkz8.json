He ordered something to go and they told the waitress she'd pay for it, they both said their goodbyes, and the guy left us alone to go wait for his lunch at some other table.\n\nSo far so good, though their conversation was a bit strange it did seem like it came up organically, it didn't needlessly drag on, and the guy was nice at all times and also polite enough to make himself scarce as soon as possible instead of inserting himself into our lunch date with the excuse that he was waiting for his food.\n\nSo we continued our conversation and everything seemed fine, until some time later after the friend had already left and it was time to settle our check, and I realized this girl obviously expected me to pay for the whole thing including the lunch she offered to pay for her friend as a way to pay him back for the favor he did her. \n\nNow, even if the friend hadn't ordered a pretty pricey meal that cost more than the rest of our check put together (and he had done exactly that), it didn't sit well with me how she had shamelessly decided to pay back him back with my money in what seemed like a deliberate scam.\n\nSo I paid for the whole thing in order to avoid making a scene, but later brought it up and told her that it wasn't cool. She made it clear that she saw nothing wrong with it and said I was being cheap and childish, so I thanked her for her honesty and told her we were done and I wasn't going to be calling her again, she tried to argue that I was overreacting but I held firm and blocked her a couple of days later because she insisted on texting me to convince me that I was wrong and we should go out again.

We had some good times out of quoting her and laughing at how dumb she was.)\n\nAnd finally, I asked one about what she does at her job because it sounds interesting. When the date was over I hadn't said much of anything else. But I heard about her job, how she got into her job, her friends, her college experience, her high school experience, her family, her ex, her other ex, that car accident she got in when she was a teen, her three trips to Disney World, etc. Interestingly enough she was upset I didn't talk more and I thought \"When? You didn't take a single breath for 45 minutes straight, when was I supposed to squeeze in a word or two?\"\n\nThere was the one where she spent more time talking about Taylor Swift than anything else, and found a way to jam her into conversations where it didn't make sense. I figured she didn't want to date me, she wanted to date Taylor Swift, and got out of there.

   "message": "Really nice guy, we hit it off. Talked on the phone for hours, had similar values, decide to meet up for lunch. He’s pretty massively overweight (400+), I am fat too (mid 200’s) so I didn’t really care. He also tells me he’s a diabetic which I’m leery of for late 20’s but we were getting along so well I thought it could be something I could be okay with. We sit down to lunch where be proceeds to order 3 cans of coke for himself, and the largest plate of food with extra sides. This was shocking to me because I’m actually really healthy for my weight, and it can be mostly attributed to childhood poverty and autoimmune disease. Like I’m fat but I’m trying my best to be healthy. I have perfect blood work, go to the doctor regularly, workout a couple times a week, cook most of my meals at home from fresh ingredients, etc. My concerns with him stemmed from the lack of care for himself, and the possibility of needing to care for him long term if I continued to see him. I wanted a partner, not someone who wasn’t making the changes after such a serious diagnosis as Type 2 diabetes. I told him after that I wasn’t feeling a connection, and honestly felt like I was betraying the fat community by rejecting him (my therapist heard a bunch about this), but I wasn’t attracted to his lack of care for himself.",
