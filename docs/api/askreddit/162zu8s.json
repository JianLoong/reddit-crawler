Then he grabbed her wrist in a death grip and pulled it away.\n\nShe was sure he was done with her. I tried reassuring her but, frankly, I was filled with dread because I had just given my first hand job a week earlier, to my now boyfriend, and I started wondering if it was equally bad but he was just too polite to say. \n\nWhen I broached the topic he \n\n1. Laughed his ass off at the other guy‚Äôs suffering and\n\n2. Assured me he wasn‚Äôt too polite to let me know if I was about to shuck his dick.",

First he told me about an anime he likes and while telling me about it he said he knows he shouldn't be watching it, I thought he meant as in he is too old for \"cartoons\" he is in his 40s for context.\n\n\nSo I told him \"hey man, there's nothing wrong with liking anime and he should watch it and not care what others think.\"\n\nThen he started explaining it was because they are evil and have satanic messages. I was like oh boy. I tried not to be judgemental, I had bad experiences with people who thought this so it did make me a little uncomfortable though.\n\n\nA little while later we were at a Christmas party we were having in class. There was a music video of a drag queen in class on the TV. He was saying some pretty homophobic stuff, but not going to far with it so I just thought it was just very mild homophobia and he wasn't doing it intentionally.\n\n\nThen after the party was ending we were pretty much alone and he came to me and said \"you know, I just don't like homosexuals.\" \n\n\nAnd I was kind of shocked because I am Bisexual and while I have seen homophobia before I have never seen it this blatant and said like it was completely normal. So I got uncomfortable and tried to keep social interactions with him to a minimum. (Hard because we are in the same class)\n\n\nNow he constantly goes on homophobic, racist, and sexist rants. I have been calling him out a lot lately, but I feel like I should maybe stop. Because it's like I am talking to a brick wall and I almost feel like I am going down to his level somehow.\n\nHe is starting to really dislike me now, which is cool because I am hoping he'll stop talking to me when he sees me shopping/walking down the street or in class.\n\n\nAlso I now wear a bi pride pin and bracelet to class because I feel like it annoys the hell out of him.\n\nTLDR: classmate feels guilty for watching anime because it's satanic, I try not to judge him even though I had bad experiences with people who said this. He ironically tells me he is unapologeticly homophobic, not knowing I was BI and goes on sexist, homophobic and racist rants Offen. And I gotta go to class with him 3 days a week, fun...",

He had these beady little evil eyes, weak handshake, squeaky voice and he just felt very slimy. He could not look anyone in the eyes when he spoke and he was very gropey. He kept saying he works in intelligence and none of us pushed it any further than that, but he kept trying to make it a point that he was a spy for the Government. Alarm bells were going off in my head all night and the next day I had to tell my wife's friend to be careful but she made me feel like shit because she thought I was trying to sabotage her final chance at love. About a year later, she finds out the weed has a wife and family, he did work for the government but only as an accountant. He had basically been preying on her vulnerability and fabricating this elaborate story to keep her on the hook. They had an investment property they were remodeling which he pretended was his own house and thats where he took my wife's friend.",

   "message": "It was an old school friend's partner I'd never met before. My friend's parents emigrated in the late 1960s and we were penpals after she went to NZ. Her partner was coming over alone for three weeks for some research to do with his MA at Otago University in Dunedin and I said he could stay with us. This was back in the 90s. When he turned up at our door he was in shorts and a vest and waving a bottle of spirits in one hand and a skateboard under the other arm. He was heavily tattooed (including his face) and dreadlocked. I maintained a friendly smile but my heart did sink, I can't lie.\n\nI was so very, very wrong. Brilliant bloke. I didn't know he was half Maori and had never encountered Maori tattoos before. The spirits were for us (he's teetotal) and he was a great house guest, always cleaned the bath after he used it, bought food and cooked really brilliant meals, very funny, the cats loved him, he took the dog for walks (who spent about three weeks gazing adoringly at him and slept at his feet) the kids and my husband loved him. He taught my kids the Haka. My kids got major kudos because the cool Maori skateboarder was staying at their house. When he left he gave us a beautiful framed drawing he'd done of a native NZ bird on a Manuka shrub as a thank you present. It taught me an important lesson. First impressions can be very misleading. I wish he'd been here for more than three weeks (although he's visited since).",

It was run by the small town, and was fairly large (50M and a diving area), so needed 5 guards on deck at all times.\n\nThe parks and recreation director, who I had never met before, comes by to check out how things are going. At this particular moment, I am the lifeguard at the bottom of the water slide, where there is a slightly elevated guard chair to sit in with a high back rest.\n\nThis day was very slow because it was cloudy out and dark storm clouds were slowly rolling over the pool. As there is only one swimmer in my entire area (a little girl that is just going down the slide over and over again and can clearly swim fine in the 3.5 ft depth), I am looking up at the sky for some time to look for any lightning that might strike so I can whistle for the pool to shut down (any lightning strikes at an outdoor pool require you to clear the pool until no strikes have occurred for a certain period of time).\n\nWell, I am wearing sunglasses at the time purely out of habit even though it wasn‚Äôt really that bright out. What I failed to think about was how I was coming off from the other side of the pool. Apparently with my sunglasses on, it looked as though my head tilted toward the sky was me resting my head back on the back rest with my eyes closed taking a snooze while actively on duty.\n\nEven though I am completely aware of my surroundings and know the director is watching across the pool, I hear ‚ÄúHEY, WAKE UP. YOU DONT GET TO NAP BECAUSE ITS SLOW‚Äù\n\nI immediately jolt up confused and gradually begin to realize he is talking to me. I yell back that I was watching the sky for lightning, and he just turns and goes back to the office without responding.\n\nWhen my rotation is done, I go back to the office and get told by the head guard that I am going home for the day and am told my shifts for the rest of the week are going to be covered by other guards, and I can pick back up next week.\n\nImmediately, I am both upset and frustrated as I was very much awake and aware of what was going on. I ask the head guard to give me the directors number so I can call and explain myself and apologize for the misunderstanding.\n\nI call and very quickly get cut off as I am explaining myself to be told this guy knows when someone is sleeping on the job and that I need to accept the consequences before I get fired altogether. At this point, not wanting to lose my job, I just say okay and get off the phone. I was furious and left without saying anything to anyone. Still makes me mad to this day lol",

When I expressed discomfort, saying I didn't want to talk about it, I said ‚ÄúPlease, i don't want to talk about this\". She just said \"Very well. We won't talk about it.\"\n\n(Just to put things in context, she wanted to know so much about me - scouting my social media - while she blurred her own profile picture.)\n\nI later told her I felt like she just interrogated me with force and wasn't okay with it. I blocked her.\n\nI understand that, for her, a Muslim woman seeking out potential partners, she wants to be careful/cautious about potential sexism/abuse from Muslim men. She's trying to protect herself as a woman and collect information about me. I understand that.\n\nTruthfully, even with that, I still perceive it as racist/Islamophobic. I can be empathetic and accomodating to understanding her needs and concerns, but if she crosses limits and accuses me of something on the grounds of my race/religion, yes, I‚Äôm not okay with that. \n\nMen, don‚Äôt put up with this.
