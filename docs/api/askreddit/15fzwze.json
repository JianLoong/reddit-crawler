While I LOVE Mexican heritage and their ancestral roots, I didn't think it was appropriate to name our son Raul. I overrode dad because we broke up around the time of our son's birth (that's another story) but I named him Benjamin. It suits him so much more than Raul, so I feel like I made the right decision.",
