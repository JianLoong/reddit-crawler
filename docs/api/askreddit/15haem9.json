I’ll pick the best tune and **serve**.\n\nI’m not ashamed of it by any means. It’s just kinda silly and I don’t do it in front of other people. This quirk started because I was told on many separate occasions that I “have a strong/powerful walk” in recent years. It started happening right around the same time I began developing a sense of confidence. At first I thought it was a weird compliment, but then it happened again and again and again.\n\nI’m actually considering looking up open auditions or whatever, so I’ve been doing it a lot lately. I think being in a runway show would be a cool life experience. Apparently I’m good at it so why not?!",

I'm so beyond the target demographic, and I feel odd watching a bunch of teens and kids in their 20s break and pop, but for whatever reason it's super intriguing to me. But none of my friends know I'm interested in this. I only watch videos and clips when no one else is watching. My wife walked in on me watching some videos and so I quickly changed the clip and she accussed me of watching pr0n. I told her she was right - I was watching Pr0n indeed.",

I even enjoy the writing (occasionally - I don't know who is responsible for the show's production/writing but it's way past its prime).\n\nI'm a woman in my 30s. I don't bother mentioning this in real life. How do you defend watching a show it's taken as a given nobody with a college education watches? It's white noise and one of those shows a person would only watch b/c they get in the habit, but I tape new episodes and watch reruns of \"good\" seasons on purpose to wind down and get to sleep more than once a week. I think the usage of Carrie Fischer and Adam West on the show was comedically ingenious. \n\nAlso, strangely, \"The Simpsons\" is another show that not a single woman I know watches or enjoys in adulthood (even reruns), but that's less shameful b/c every millennial has fond memories of \"The Simpsons\" golden age. \n\nSome people have happy memories with friends. I have them with TV.",
