You might think that‚Äôs bad however he then took the same hand, squeezed it down the front of his jeans and sniffed even harder. The worst part was that on each grand inhale he was groaning incredibly loud. He managed all of this whilst peeing by the way, didn‚Äôt spill a drop. \n\nTo this day he doesn‚Äôt know I saw it, he most likely still does it, and I get a great big kick out of seeing him knowing what I know, seeing what I have seen",

His partner had recently had a baby and it was the first time I'd seen him since, so I wanted to enquire about his offspring's well being. Trouble is, I couldn't remember whether he'd now got a son, or a daughter...so I had to ask more generally.  \n\nOf course, I should've said \"how's the new baby?\" or \"how is fatherhood?\" But no, my brain chose to utter the words \"how's your little one?\". To a man standing at the urinal. \n\nCue a long pause....before he said \"I do hope you're talking about my son\". \n\nCringe.",

   "message": "When I was younger about 14 I was peeing beside this older guy (about 30 or 35) at a college football game. The game was tight and towards the end so everyone was out watching it but I needed to pee and didn‚Äôt care so I went to the bathroom. It was just me and him in the bathroom and I walked up next to the urinal beside him to piss because that was the closest to me. \n\nHe was kind of grungy sounding and looking and had a very loud stream. Without really thinking I looked over and saw an absolutely massive cock. I at the time was still going through puberty, and was a bit of a late bloomer but either way I‚Äôve always been average. I was totally flabbergasted at what I had just seen and unfortunately made the mistake of looking up and making eye contact with the guy who was staring right at me while I was staring at his huge cock. He gave me this crazy look, and said in a deep, low voice. ‚ÄúOh yeaaa‚Äù I forced myself to stop peeing, stuck my dick back in my pants, which still streamed a little bit of pee into my jeans and rushed out of the bathroom while he laughed behind me like some kind of orc from the lord of the rings.",

   "message": "Had to pee in a subway station in vienna after a party at 3am. I had a look in the separate restroom for pooping and since there was shit all over the place I decided to  go to the urinals.\n\nWhen I walked in 3 of 4 urinals were already taken. After starting my business it took several seconds for me to realize that there were no peeing noises from the other men.\n\nHaving a look around I realized all 3 of them were masturbating üò± Quickest piss of my life.\n\nThe best thing was:\nSome months later at the same station I had to piss again. I hesitated but went in anyway and sure enough someone was masturbating again.\n\nIf you're in Vienna (which is lovely), maybe skip the restroom at U3 Mariahilferstra√üe üòÖ",

   "message": "Not sure this counts because it wasn't awkward at the time (though it definitely should have been). I was really drunk at a bar, celebrating my 25th, many years ago. I get pee shy occasionally and standing at a urinal in this tiny, totally packed out restroom, I just couldn't go. I knew a bunch of people were queuing to go, and that just made it even worse. \n\nAnyways, this guy who starts using the urinal beside me notices what's happening (don't ask me how he noticed, but he was as drunk as me.) After he finishes up, he starts encouraging me to pee. It starts with some words of encouragement like \"you got this\". But it quickly escalates... Soon he's chanting. The whole restroom knows what's going on and starts joining in. Some guy comes up and does this little massage on my shoulders and tells me to relax. All while I'm standing at this urinal. You can't make this stuff up.\n\nAnyway, we're all so drunk this becomes absolutely hilarious. I'm crying with laughter and do actually start relaxing. Long story short, it worked. Would have been a very different (awkward) story without the beers!",

   "message": "I was 13 or 14 and I was one of the last guys to get to the bathroom after a movie. I'm mid flow when I hear an odd set of shoes enter with unusual haste. I look over my shoulder and see a young woman see the 2 stalls locked and approach the urinal immediately next to me in heels and a cute summer dress.\n\"The ladies line is always so long, don't you agree?\" She says, as she dropped her panties to the ground and stuffed them into her crossbody purse. She lifted her dress, adjusted, and emits a sigh of relief as she clearly had practiced this before. \"Yeah...\" I say with a flummoxed expression, trying to allow my adolescent brain comprehend what I'm seeing. She proceeds to converse with me about how she had too much to drink before the movie but it was so good she couldn't leave her seat. I finish up, off to wash my hands and I hear her again, \"Could you hand me a paper towel? I was too rushed when I came in to remember. As I washed my hands, I built up the courage to confront the situation my early teenage self had been presented with. I finish up, dry my hands, grab a few paper towels and walk them her way. \"How did you learn to do that?\" I ask. Her reply, \"I wanted to be popular in college and it worked, but for the wrong reasons.\" She blots, throws the paper towel in the trash, washes her hands and then chats with me out the door of the movie theater. My dad is smoking a cigarette, talking to my brother about the movie as we walk out. \"It was good to meet you\" she says as she grabs the arms of some other well-dressed girls and walks off. My dad says, \"Who was that?\" I reply, \"I met her at the urinal. She was nice, but really chatty.\" As my brother and father exchange disbelieving glances at one another, my dad shakes his head and says,\"Doesn't she know? No one talks at a urinal.\"",
