Maybe I take a shot at it\nand maybe I break it. And T'm\nreal happy with myself, 'cause I\ndid my job well. But maybe that\ncode was the location of some\nrebel army in North Africa or\nthe Middle East. Once they have\nthat location, they bomb the\nvillage where the rebels were\nhiding and fifteen hundred\npeople I never met, never had\nno problem with, get killed. Now\nthe politicians are sayin', \"0h,\nsend in the Marines to secure\nthe area\" 'cause they don't give a\nshit. It won't be their kid over\nthere. gettin' shot. Just like it\nwasn't them when their number\ngot called, 'cause they were\npullin' a tour in the National\nGuard. It'11 be some kid from\nSouthie takin' shrapnel in the\nass. And he comes back to find\nthat the plant he used to work at\ngot exported to the country he\njust got back from. And the guy\nwho put the shrapnel in his ass\ngot his old job, 'cause he'll work\nfor fifteen cents a day and no\nbathroom breaks. Meanwhile\nhe realizes the only reason he\nwaS over there in the first place\nwas so we could install a\ngovernment that would sell us\noil at a good price. And, of\ncourse, the oil companies used\nthe skirmish over there to scare\nup domestic oil prices. A cute\nlittle ancillary benefit for them,\nbut it ain't helping my buddy at\ntwo-fifty a gallon. And they're\ntakin' their sweet time bringin'\nthe oil back, of course, and\nmaybe even took the liberty of\nhiring an alcoholic skipper who\nlikes to drink martinis and\nfuckin' play slalom with the\nicebergs, and it ain't too long 'til\nhe hits one, spills the oil and\nkills all the sea life in the North\nAtlantic. So now my buddy's out\nof work and he can't afford to\ndrive, so he's got to walk to the\nfuckin' job interviews, which\nsucks 'cause the shrapnel in his\nass is givin' him chronic\nhemorrhoids. And meanwhile\nhe's starvin, 'cause every time\nhe tries to get a bite to eat, the\nonly blue plate special they're\nservin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I\nthink? I'm holdin' out for\nsomethin' better. I figure fuck it\nwhile I'm at it why not just shoot\nmy buddy, take his job, give it to\nhis sworn enemy, hike up gas\nprices, bomb a village, club a\nbaby seal, hit the hash pipe and\njoin the National Guard? I could\nbe elected president.",
