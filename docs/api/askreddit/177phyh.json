I don't want Biden to run. I want a reset on our politics and some civility in debates. Please for the love of God, just go away.\n\nLet's bring back a diverse choice of people. I want more Yangs, Sanders, Romneys. Not that I support any of them specifically, I just liked that they were different enough from each other to represent something of an actual choice, and that they are all respectful and civil in debates.",
