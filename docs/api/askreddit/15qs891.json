   "message": "Grew up in the 90s. I'm kinda surprised how many here are saying internet considering it was a thing, pretty widely used and advancing at a rapid pace. I don't think anyone in the 90s would be surprised just how big the internet would be 30 years from now. Ya it's far faster, reliable and accessible nearly everywhere. But I don't think it's surprising that was the progression.\n\nNow smart phones? Ya.... now that would blow my mind apart. The best laptops were thousands of dollars, absolutely huge and slower than sin.\n\nAnd the fact everyone one has one in their pockets and can literally play videos games that out put any games in the 90s to shame performance wise.\n\nAlso 911. If you told me there was a terrorist attack that killed nearly 5000 on us Soil. I would've assumed nukes would fly and the Ww3 went hot.\n\nSelf landing large rocketry\n\nJames webb my dude... I was STUNNED when I saw some.of the hubble images and James Webb blew that out of the water.",
