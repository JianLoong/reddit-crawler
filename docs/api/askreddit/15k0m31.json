Also do FM radio (but a lot of phones used to do that), plus track aircraft (ADS-B), listen in to air traffic control, etc.\n\nI've connected a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard before now (in Android, a cursor appears if you can get any mouse device connected, Bluetooth or USB).  Works on all Android phones.\n\nI also have Samsung Dex, so plugging it into HDMI turns it into an Android desktop.\n\nI have a spirit-level app that uses the orientation sensors, and I've used that when doing DIY.  Also a ruler app for things smaller than the screen.  I've used a bright-white app to see 35mm film (I have some cinema frames of famous movies).  I've  connected webcams and microscopes and the snake-cams you use in drains just over USB.\n\nI've connected it to my car OBD to diagnose faults showing on the ECU and reset other people's car ECUs.  I emulate the old TI graphing calculator I used to use when I was in school (and it's the quickest way to do some calculations and better than the built in calculator apps).\n\nI've read credit and access cards with NFC (to show people that their secure cards aren't as secure as they think) as well as pulled passport images out of passports just by touching them.  I've taken credit card payments on it (using a Square / iZettle / etc. reader) and printed our receipts for people (bluetooth receipt printer).\n\nI've scanned entire documents using the camera, encoded video on the go (FFMPEG), controlled projectors and TVs (with a headphone adaptor to run irplus WAVE like a universal IR remote).\n\nI use it for Wake-on-LAN and scanning local wireless networks, I use it as a remote Steam client and played games using it as a controller, and using controllers with it to play old emulated games.  I've used it as a go-to aligner for my telescope (strap it to the telescope and then tell it what you want to look at and it guides you there).\n\nAnd I use it to charge other devices, and charge from other devices (including my laptop, both ways).\n\nPeople sometimes ask me why I use a particular type of phone, and there's a reason.  You can't do all the above with \"just apps\", you have to have certain features in the hardware for it to work and some expensive phones have nowhere near the stuff I use all the time.\n\nMy hardware gets used, a lot, for all kinds of things.  It has to be able to do all kinds of things to be useful to me.  Your flashy iPhone doesn't do half the stuff I want to be able to do, even if I only need that feature every now and then.",

Though I told her that you can double tap the power key to get the camera up, it's not as slick as my old K800i but it's pretty handy.   \n\n\nI am usually surprised as the performance of my phones, I buy phones from Cubot, they are around £100 for the mid-range I buy and they do everything I need. I have been watching videos from Smoorezz on youtube who covers cheaper and nastier phones (in fact he's only reviewed Cubot once as they are a \"proper\" phone manufacturer) he tests games like GTA 3, SA and others as well as doing a benchmark test. I ran the same on my old Cubot which is 2 years old and my new one, both came out with pretty impressive specs and if I wanted to I could run 3D GTA games smoothly on my phone at maximum specs. \n\n I was surprised as I don't expect to do anything on my smartphone that isn't browsing Reddit, watching youtube, browsing the web, listening to music, taking and recording decent enough video and photographs, finding my way when i'm lost and a few other basic features.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure most people with a high end £1000 Samsung or iphone don't realise exactly the sort of power they yield and i'm sure most don't run intensive applications on them.",

Any photo! It doesn't have to be one you've taken and the text can be skewed or stylized any which way. If you long press on the subject of a photo it will also let you copy just the subject so you can have a transparent background.",
