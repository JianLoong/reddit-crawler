During his examination he kept pushing on my lower torso/uterus area and every time I screamed in pain he'd tell me to stop being dramatic and that if I didn't stop flexing that area then he'd have to push harder. I wasn't flexing that area but he insisted that I was.\n\nI kind of zoned in and out of the rest of the exam but I remember realizing I was completely screwed when he was literally hopping up and down to be able to feel what was going on. Eventually he proclaimed that I probably just have an upset stomach due to being fat and that he'd draw blood if it got my mom to stop \"enabling\" me. His nurse couldn't get a vein after multiple attempts in both arms. When a different nurse tried multiple times she finally went \"Oh, you're really dehydrated\" to which the doctor then chastised me for drinking too much soda which likely caused the dehydration.\n\nMy mom was frantic and kept my doctor up to date with everything that was happening. My doctor told her to just take me and leave and try to hold out until we reached the closest ER. As we were leaving the doctor told us that he had already called ahead to multiple nearby ERs in our plan to let them know that I was just trying to get pain meds and to not give them to me.\n\nEventually my pain started subsiding and we drove to my regular doctor. She was beyond pissed and ended up helping us file a shit ton of paperwork to complain to the medical board about what happened. My doctor's biggest push to my mom about why she should file an official complaint and negligence claim was because\n\n1. He didn't know what was wrong and if someone complains of pain somewhere you shouldn't be pushing so hard that you're jumping up and down to dig in because you could be making things WAY worse.\n\n2. Due to the pain being caused by a cyst popping there was a good chance that digging his fingers into my lower torso could have caused more to pop\n\n3. If a patient comes in screaming and crying saying they're in pain, you shouldn't automatically dismiss it, especially when they continue showing signs of pain when you touch the area they're complaining about.",

   "message": "I hate going to the doctor. I used to do Muay Thai before COVID and one night I took a kick to the pads in my hand and the kick hit to the side instead of on center, spinning the pad around and wrenching my wrist. The next morning it looked like I had a purple and black ping pong ball shoved under my skin so off to the doc I went. He didn‚Äôt even X-ray me, just bent me all around while I gasped and drew air in through my teeth (I have a very high pain tolerance, I didn‚Äôt even scream during my drug free childbirths). Then he chastised me for doing martial arts because I didn‚Äôt need them to be the first at the school pickup line. To this day I‚Äôm pretty sure I did some damage because the joint likes to pop out of place at random and aches. \n\nAnother doc, well I don‚Äôt want to go too into details. I was assaulted during a pap exam by a female NP who refused to do the breast exam I‚Äôd scheduled after finding a lump. Instead she said I needed a pap and assaulted me, it felt like she was stabbing my cervix with the sample brushes; it was more painful than having my IUD inserted. I‚Äôd never felt so violated. \n\nI went home and was cramping so badly for days, almost contraction like in sensation and I bled like a stuck pig. I had such extreme pain I couldn‚Äôt use tampons. I was in my late 30s and had never had an experience afterwards like that. My husband finally convinced me to file a complaint with the office. They brought me in immediately. Got my breast exam and lump confirmed. One cancer free biopsy result later and about six weeks of no sex I felt better and the doc was no longer practicing at their office.",

I tried hot baths, pain relievers, walking around the house, nothing helped. After a few nights my son insisted I go to the ER. Got a shot of morphine and the pain immediately went away. Got sent for a scan and told to see my doctor in the morning.\n Went to the doc and had a chat with him, he reviewed the ER report and told me he was going to call right now and  add me to the surgical list that day. He stepped outside he room and I heard him on the phone saying he had a 42 YO F with end stage cancer to add to the surgical schedule that day. I freaked! He stepped back inside and I asked him why didn't he tell me I had end stage cancer. He jerked and said it was the patient in the next room. I was relieved for me, but I sure hope she didn't hear that phone call. Got the last surgery of the night and removed my gall bladder.

   "message": "I don‚Äôt know if this will get traction, but as a gay man in a conservative place I had sex for the first time with someone that claimed they hadn‚Äôt had sex. I was seventeen, he was older. We were together for two years and never used protection. When we broke up he admitted that I wasn‚Äôt his first and in fact there had been many. Sometimes when we were together. I was involved with an LGBT group at that time that encouraged STI testing. I never thought I needed it but I went to planned parenthood because they offered cheap testing for gay people as well. That clinic took my blood, did their swabs, all of it. I was told I would get a phone call with my results if I gave them an identifying code. They called. I gave the code. The woman on the phone said, I found your results, but I need an appointment now. I asked why and she said only a doctor can give your results now. I made an appointment that was two weeks later. I went to that appointment and I was told I needed to check in and normally a nurse could give my results but my situation requires a doctor. So I cried in the waiting room. I assumed after all of these hoops that I had jumped through, it must be awful news. I got called back. The first nurse in the room looked at my chart and said she needed to find the doctor. I was fully just sobbing at this point. Finally the doctor they were all talking about walked in and said I‚Äôm disease free but I should question my lifestyle so this wouldn‚Äôt happen again. They also kicked me the fuck out. I had to walk back through the clinic crying. I sat in my car crying with relief and anger. \n\nAt least in my time, planned parenthood was as bad as right wing bullshit because I was a faggot. It really felt like they dragged everything out and implied things just to make me afraid to be gay. \n\nAlso, my best friend slept with a ton of men, got pregnant and planned parenthood helped her \n\nI get that this was a local chapter or something, but this was a huge college town before being gay was okay. Our only cheap clinic was planned parenthood.\n\nThere are other ways to support women and gay men.",

   "message": "I have lots of bad experiences with doctors offices.\n\nI specialise in intellectual disability and mental health, both are things that general doctors and nurses know little about. I'm also a psychologist, however I work very closely with many of my clients as my company also provide general support services and occasionally I will need to assist a client to attend a GP visit. When I do, 90% of the time they presume I am a lowly undereducated support worker.\n\nI have had a flying doctor in a rural/remote hospital tell me that because the patient who had just had a heart attack had no family and an obvious disability, once in the air they would just \"let him go\". I've never had to suppress white hot rage like that before, but I managed to deal with her respectfully and keep the patient alive.\n\nTook my sister, who has a severe intellectual disability, (but does not \"present\" as disabled) to a GP, and the GP refused to allow me into the room with them. I tried to explain (sister at the time was nearly non-verbal and didn't know what she was there for anyway) but he was condescending and dismissive, absolutely certain of himself and that I was meddling. \nAfter quite firmly being shut down, I said okay then, and took a seat in the waiting room.\nAbout 2 minutes later he popped his head out looking a little less certain of himself and asked if I wanted to come in. I replied that I was sure he had it well in hand, he'd be alright without me no doubt.\n5 minutes later he popped back out and asked me to please come in. Complete attitude change. I went in and my sister had taken everything off his desk and put it in her bag, and was happily dancing to herself and playing with his container of tongue depressors.\nHe looked at me and almost apologetically said \" I think she may have a disability of some sort\". I told him that was very astute of him, emptied my sisters bag of his desk things, grabbed my sister and left to find another doctor.\n\nHad a GP, and then 2 different ER doctors tell me a client was fine, despite being yellow and constantly vomiting. I pulled Ryan's Rule and forced them to test, client had a ruptured gallbladder.\n\nBriefly had an aboriginal client with mild mental health issues (nothing too serious) stumble and collapse in the gutter, doctors and nurses all said he was drunk (patient was known to us to not be a drinker) and sent him home. Dead of a brain aneurysm 45 minutes later (and autopsy revealed no drugs or alcohol for the record)\n\nClient (single dad to 4 kids) has severe abdominal pain, and vomiting for 2 days, dehydrated and cannot walk. So sick he can't get out of bed. His kids actually walked to our office to get help, call an ambulance and get him to the hospital, where they turn him away for drug seeking behaviour - and report him to Children's Services.\nChildren's services arrive a couple of hours later, enter the home where he has been returned (and yes it was a mess, dude wasn't doing any housekeeping due to being bedridden) and Children's services took one look at him and went \" oh, this dude is sick as hell\" and called another ambulance. Children's services put the kids with us while he was in hospital.\nHe gets to hospital a second time, and they turn him away *again* for drug seeking behaviour. He is sent home.\nSo I go pick him up, take him to the hospital a third tine where they try to argue the problem is mental health, the symptoms are psychosomatic. I argue they are a hospital, do their darned jobs. I kicked up enough of a stink that they finally scanned his abdomin and found some mesh from an old surgery had come loose and was fucking up his gut.\n\nHad several GPs tell schizophrenic patients they could safely stop taking their medication.\n\nHealthcare for people with intellectual disabilities and/or mental health issues really need strong advocates because they are so often dismissed by regular medical personnel. Especially if they have a \"dual diagnosis\", because all too often a GP will ignore a mental health problem in favour of the disability or vice versa (they dont need medication for this, they're just disabled\" or \"intellectual disability? No, this behaviour is because they're obviously on drugs/have a mental illness\")\n\nI have more stories but this is already too long.",
