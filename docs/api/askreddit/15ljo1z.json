But having zero self confidence, I kept my mouth shut, thinking that I‚Äôd been friendzoned.\n\nAs we moved through school, we were split up and put into different classes. We tried to keep up but eventually drifted apart (this was pre-social media and mobile phones) and eventually our lives took different paths.\n\nWe bumped into each other now and then but she was always involved with someone at the time so we kept things pleasant and went our ways. We both got on with our lives, moved on and soon settled down, starting families of our own.\n\nFast forwards a decade or two and we end up applying for the same job so now we work closely together. It was like 25yrs hadn‚Äôt happened and we went straight back to being best friends. She confessed to having unresolved feelings for me too and that she never made a move because she also thought she‚Äôd been friendzoned.\n\nHad either of us said something, the course of our lives could have been very different. For now, we‚Äôve talked it through and agreed on boundaries, lines that can never be crossed. Still fucking hurts though.",
