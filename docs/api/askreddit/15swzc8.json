This is why cats with cats and dogs with dogs don't produce viably very often. The incest from repeated owner-rape of the cat or dog line makes the results mitochondrially shallow. If, however, a post-cat gets together with a post-dog, the most curious thing happens, called a Raccoon. Notably, like their human forebears, as you see, raccoons have opposable thumbs. Manx-labrador hybrid makes an opossum. Freaky! I could do this all day! Gorilla goat hybrid all at once makes Australopithecus (pygmy). Gorilla sexing an Australopithecus all at once makes Cro Magnon. You can have up to eight twins at a time, half boys, half girls, half the boys are gay, half the girls are gay, with passing alleles. So to produce Neanderthal (gays and lesbians) you need a giant cumshot from a Cro, which equally bastes the uterus in semen.",
