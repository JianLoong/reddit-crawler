   "message": "I held her hand one last time.\n\nHer skin felt clammy. The warmth of her touch was fading like the last embers of a summer campfire. Her head rested back against the pillows that propped her up. The beeps of the heart rate monitor steadily grew quieter. It wouldn't be long now. I wanted to say something, anything, to comfort her in these last few moments that we would have together. Nothing could make it through the tightness of my throat. Tears began to roll down my cheeks as I held her hand, squeezing it gently, hoping to convey what I couldn't say through words. All the while, that soft smile of hers never left her lips.\n\n\"I had fun,\" She managed to speak through dry, cracked lips. \"Let's go out again. When-\" And her head went limp.\n\nI could only weep. The dull droning of the heart monitor was the loudest sound I could ever recall hearing. As the doctors rushed into the room, I pressed her hand to my lips and kissed it softly.\n\n\"I love you,\" I said, the words I had been unable to say before spilling out from the depths of my soul. \"I love you more than anything.\"",
