As \"punishment\" for her refusal Snow had her entire family murdered. Fast forward to the the main books and she is once again forced into the Games in _Catching Fire_ after which she's imprisoned and tortured by the Capitol, resulting in a drug addiction and such severe PTSD that even just getting slightly wet causes severe panic attacks.",
