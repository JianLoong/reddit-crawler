Either the clit or the small bundle that is located between their vaginal opening and their anus. Grinding is how we orgasm for the most part, not thrusting. Also, if you want to orgasm with a partner you have to get out of your own head and let yourself go. Don't think. Just feel and don't be embarassed about whether or not you look weird or are making too much noise. Just do what feels good. Enjoy yourself.",

   "message": "How different people's bodies are. I thought I was weird when I was a teen.\n\nI think in sex Ed class there should also be a slide of many different pictures of different naked bodies. Not drawings, naked people. Adults. It should be taught how nudity is not inherently sexual and for teens to be mature about it.\n\nBreasts can be big and small, if they're big, they won't float, they can be round, to the sides, pointy, asymmetrical, in a V or U shape, have dark or light aureolas, big ones and small ones, inverted nipples, they can be high on the chest or very low. \n\nDick has foreskin naturally (this lesson should be taught especially in the US because apparently most people are cut and having foreskin is considered different) and it should be taught that removing it when your kid is just born shouldn't be that normalized. Foreskin exists to protect the head because it's sensitive, so if you don't have that problem where you can't see the head because the foreskin can't separate, then there's no reason to cut your kids body before they can even think.\n\nIt should be taught how labia has different sizes, colors and shapes and how it's normal. People shouldn't associate labia with having a lot of sex and neither that if you have sex = you get loose. That's not how it works. \n\nAlso teach how people have body hair...... The same way I don't understand the expectation of men not having foreskin (which is the norm, you're born with it) I don't understand the expectation of people being hairless (mostly for women). Hair grows in everybody, the expectation should be of having hair, even a bit like oh okay they shaved 2 days ago, and if they're hairless that's a cool different thing. I've had friends saying they shaved super fast because they were going to meet their boyfriends unexpectedly and the next day they were all red and itchy",
