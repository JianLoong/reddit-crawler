Hows the weather going to be?  \n\n\nI mean at a certain point your going to have to start asking questions about who's feeding em and where the money is coming from to doing these things......Lawyers aren't cheap, those businesses have back ends. I'm sure ASIO resources could be better spent elsewhere. But they did say there is likely hood of a supremacist attack in the next year, don't know what the pure worthy people they are protecting are doing on that day....presumably living the dream Four'n'twenty N\\*\\*\\*'s wish they actually had.  \n\n\nFor me it was a pretty big moral downer as a chemist when I found out an unusually large number of them were on 6 figure salaries and also my neighbors.  \n\n\n https://www.theage.com.au/national/inside-racism-hq-how-home-grown-neo-nazis-are-plotting-a-white-revolution-20210812-p58i3x.html  \n\n\nMight be more effective to let everyone else know how well paid they are to do what they do  and just watch productivity tank across the state. I'm sure the reserve bank will tut some more.  \n\n\nSuddenly the financiers have to decide on the productivity loss or putting the fear in to the darkie unappreciated people asking for a raise.",
