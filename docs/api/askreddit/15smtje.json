   "message": "Fast food in general. It‚Äôs all too expensive now. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend upwards of $30 for my husband and I when we could go to an actual restaurant for nearly the same price. We just eat exclusively at home now.\n\nEdit: seems like lots of people are asking about the price comparisons. I know prices can easily vary greatly by location.\n\nExample: if I go to El tapatio and order Burritos deluxe which is 2 burritos (one chicken and beans and one beef and beans) and a side of either beans or rice, it‚Äôs $8.50. This could have also changed based on the last time I was there.\n\nIf I go to Taco Bell and get a chicken and cheese burrito (not listed on the menu here so it has to be customized from a bean burrito to add chicken) and a beef and bean burrito (also not on the menu here and has to be customized as well) it‚Äôs already nearing the price of the other restaurant but the burritos are about half the size and there is no side. Then you would have to double your Taco Bell order and add a side so now it comes close to $15 when I could go to an actual, non fast food restaurant for the same amount of food for less money and better food.\n\nIf I go to Cracker Barrel, most of their breakfast meals are under $15 here. A few are under $10.\n\nWhen we dine out (maybe 3 or 4 times a year) we don‚Äôt buy sides (especially if they already have sides as part of the meal) and we don‚Äôt buy drinks (alcohol, sodas, tea, etc). Lastly, we don‚Äôt buy dessert.",
