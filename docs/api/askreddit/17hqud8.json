If its an Earth like planet with life, something like Gaia or Sanctuary.\n\nIf its a dead world thats either barely inhabitable, or not at all, then maybe something like Vasinane, which is Latin for Empty Vessel.\n\nIf its a gas giant, then maybe something to do with the size of it, Prometheus, or Terastios (greek for huge or gigantic)\n\nCould also be named for specific features, maybe its a planet with something never seen anywhere else that is the defining feature of that planet. An example I can think of from sci fi is the planet Crematoria from the Chronicles of Riddick, obviously named because half of it is a blast furnace at any given time.",
