Chocolate bars, wrapping paper, popcorn, cheesecake, cookie dough, coupon books, state fair tickets, etc. It was always something and they'd have assemblies and charts and shit to pump it up and make it super competitive so all the kids wanted to sell the most to get shitty prizes. We'd go door to door through neighborhoods and stand out in front of stores trying to sell as much as we could. \n\nI never thought about it until I got older, but somebody's making a lot of money off of kids selling their product. I know they're fundraisers and the school gets a cut, but I have no doubt that there are multi millionaires who made their money from these *fundraisers*. It just seems like a loophole for child labor.",
