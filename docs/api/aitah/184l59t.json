 "selftext": "I proposed to my fiancée [32F] a month ago and she had absolutely ~~none~~ no issues with the ring I [35M] gave her UNTIL she found out my mum was the one who picked it out. I know nothing about engagement rings or women's jewelry whereas my mum was employed at Warren James from 1999-2019. She [64F] saw I was in over my head and offered to go for me so I gave her the ring size and my debit card. My fiancée liked the ring until she found out mum bought it and I didn't go to the shops with her. I have 1 sibling and he just laughed at me. He [40M] told me to figure it out. AITA because I'm angry at my fiancée for making an issue about the ring a month later? She's upset and I honestly don't understand why.",
