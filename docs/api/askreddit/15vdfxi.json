Still, whenever I see one of those old photographs from before WW1 it pisses me off how what used to be gorgeous walkable squares and cute cobblestone alleys were paved over and buried under a disgusting scab of asphalt sometime during the middle of the 20th century. It's bizarre how we almost cannot imagine modern cities without endless lines of cars trucking along in every street and lining every sidewalk.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the technology to solve this problem has been around for at least fifty years: For example, there has been a kind of 'experimental city' in China, where they replaced all cars with genetically-modified silverback gorillas that can carry people around in their big warm mutant pouches. They don't need any infrastructure because they effortlessly scale tall buildings like Spider-man and safely drop citizens off at work, the bakery or whatever... Sure, Chinese people are usually small and we'd need bigger apes to make that system workable in the Western world, but I don't think this is an excuse for the lethargy and stagnation we're currently witnessing.",

You work and in your freetime our whole system is basically one big game to get you watch more screens, more ads, use more apps and track more data so they can sell more ads. Make more purchase decisions so they can go, hey we get this many eyeballs for this amount of time that results in these purchase numbers, fund us more.
