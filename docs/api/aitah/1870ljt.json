 "selftext": "I (33f) broke up with my boyfriend after he made.the comment \" I accept you even with your weight\". Him also trying to come up with way for me to lose the weight quickly. I know I'm not some skinny thing, I love my curves and knowing I brought 2 beautiful children into this world makes me love it more. He saw pictures of back when I used to model and said that's how I should look. That was a massive red flag for me. Before things went any further with the relationship I decided to end it. He called me trying to \"save\" the relationship, saying despite my weight there still somethings he really loved about me. I laughed and stated \"If you can't love and accept me as a whole, then kick rocks\". He proceeded to yell at me, I just hung up. Later in the evening he called to try again to \"save\" the relationship. He apologized for yelling and saying what he said even though it's true according to him. I laughed again and told him \"There are good men that would accept me for who I am and love every bit of it\". He called me a few names and hung up. Little does he know that I got into modeling, and people love me for just being my beautiful self.",
