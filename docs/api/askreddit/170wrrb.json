So fucking lucky dude. \n\nI have a problem with nitrous, I can't do it anymore or hes done, and my partner was gonna take me to Vegas this week. Along with a concert, and to his bosses horror house for halloween. We had a slight bickering with each other over Vegas. He doesn't want me having a melt down because I haven't been doing good lately and fighting and being mean to him. But he wants to give me another chance thinking maybe getting out of the house will help. I chose to go buy nitrous. Now I don't think I get to go anymore. Not fucking worth it dude. And we might break up. I don't have anywhere to go. And I can't survive on my own. \n\nIt wasn't worth it. It never is. I've racked up $1000s in CC that I can't afford. I had almost a 700 credit score I've been beating my ass building up this year. Now its 520. In just a month and a half. \n\nI was gonna go to fucking Vegas dude. I never go anywhere. I've been on like 2 vacations in my adult life. And I fucking ruined it to get high one fucking day. I don't have a good time on nitrous. I cry and scream and talk to myself.
