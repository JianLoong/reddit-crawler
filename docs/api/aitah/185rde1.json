 "selftext": "So we‚Äôve been married for 30+ years 3 adult children. We have remodeled and flipped houses, very hands on being my previous profession in interior design and my husbands experience in construction ( he‚Äôs a developer) hands on meaning I literally ripped out and finished what was replaced including painting the entire exterior and interior of our homes. So I became a SAHM as we both agreed to before the multiple home construction projects began and multiple kids. I have devoted my time to guiding our kids thru private school apps (it‚Äôs ridiculously stressful for all) and providing all guidance and support for our kids. Kids now growen and out of the house and I am now being told ‚Äúhe makes all the money so I don‚Äôt have a say in how he spends‚Äù nothing new gone on for years! My current concern is nearing retirement and he seems completely oblivious. When I mentioned that even though I don‚Äôt hav a paycheck my fees for all I have done to further our family are significant had I presented a bill, he mocked me. He has a very stressful job, makes a lot of money but I‚Äôm tired of him rubbing in my face that he‚Äôs the one with the paycheck. AITAH for voicing concern about spending so close to retirement while reminds me I don‚Äôt make the money?",

   "message": "Wow reading commentary and OP this is going to be an interesting thread. \n\nLet‚Äôs just bluntly put it out there you are not an AH for expecting your spouse to discuss with you. I made 10x my wife‚Äôs income even before she went part time and I‚Äôve always treated it as our money. Occasionally, I have to remind her to keep in mind our spending (she isn‚Äôt bad it‚Äôs more of avoiding lifestyle creep) because she doesn‚Äôt track any of our spending. \n\nAs to the rest of it have you and your husband ever sat down and review the finances? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with spending near retirement if the money has been invested well and often you have the income to do it at that point. Now my wife and I discuss big expenses but for the most part when it comes to investing and budgets I handle all of it - not because I make the lion share but frankly I have a far better grasp of the numbers. Investments are 100% in my court and I‚Äôve started large investment purchases before even discussing with her. When I do fill her in on the loop she never bats an eye because she‚Äôs watch the impact over the years. In terms of budgeting - she really doesn‚Äôt have a budget she has to manage. our spending is in line with our plans and the only things we discuss ahead of time are car purchases. \n\nThat works for us. Ive always been happy to walk my wife through all our finances and she has a broad sense of when we will retire (50s) and items like that but she doesn‚Äôt care to really go through line by line. So I‚Äôve got a breakdown of instructions for all accounts I maintain in a safe - it‚Äôs an if I die file to be honest.  I will say if she started questioning purchases without being willing to go through all the numbers I‚Äôd probably be annoyed and push back. So if the context is like that - our husband may have a point even if he is being an AH. But you aren‚Äôt wrong to want to get into it and discuss it with you. I‚Äôm be curious about the context of the discussion. Are you questioning the purchase or are you asking to learn more about your shared finances?",
