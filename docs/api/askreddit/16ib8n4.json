   "message": "I can't remember exactly what star it was, but there was a star deep in space that astrophysicists saw as relatively unremarkable. Just another star they were monitoring.\n\nAnyway, one day, all was normal, it was in the correct position. The next day, they were monitoring all the stars, and this one star had just disappeared. Poof.\n\nNo one could figure out why. It could have been that it went supernova, but if it had, they would have seen the residue and the massive explosion, plus all the gaseous residue. So it can't have gone bang. They also hypothesised that maybe a civilisation had constructed a Dyson sphere (a large construction made to harvest all of a stars potential energy), but if so, it would have been more than likely that we would have seen the star slowly disappear, the light fading as the civilisation constructed the Dyson sphere. Now, of course, according to the Kardashev scale, there could well be a civilisation so advanced that they could have just constructed the entire sphere in a matter of seconds, but we'll never know.\n\nOn that subject, that same civilisation could have just absorbed the star instantly to use its power.\n\nThey thought that maybe, other extrasolar objects were just blocking its view somehow, so they continued to monitor its location. It never came back.\n\nSomewhere, out there, a star just miraculously disappeared without a trace. And we will never know how or why.\n\nThat's what's so disturbing to me. We have such amazing technology to monitor objects millions of light years away, yet we cannot figure out why a star just disappeared without a trace. And we may never know.",

Investigators thought it belonged to a woman named Lakesha Levy and was buried with her. However, Levy's actual leg was found later and then buried with her. All of the other (known) victims had their correct left legs buried with them. To muddy the waters further, DNA testing was impossible due to the embalming the body went through.\n\n...So, whose leg was it? Almost thirty years later, we still have no idea.\n\nThis is where the conspiracies come in. Timothy McVeigh swore there wasn't a third accomplice. His lawyer, however, insisted there was. Various conflicting eyewitness accounts state there were unidentified people in McVeigh's company in the days leading up to the attack, but these are tenuous at best. There's been accusations of a cover up after one of the suspects committed suicide in custody and the Feds seemed to drop the case entirely afterwards. Did they cause a man to commit suicide after wrongfully accusing him and then try to hush everything up afterwards?",

   "message": "If we‚Äôre going to talk about some real unsolved mysteries, here‚Äôs a couple that I find unsettling, unusual and disturbing. \n\nThe Setagaya Family Murders - \nOn New Years Eve in 2000, a family of four is attacked and murdered by a home invader in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo, Japan. After brutally killing the parents and two children, the killer remained in the house for hours, eating their food, using the bathroom, logging into the family computer and even taking a nap. Despite leaving tons of evidence, they‚Äôve never been able to trace it to anyone. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setagaya_family_murder\n\nKurt Sova - \nAfter attending a house party in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, 17 year old Kurt Sova disappeared on October 28, 1981 and was missing for five days before his body was discovered in an area believed to have been previously searched. The coroner determined he had died 24-36 hours before he was found, nor could they verify his cause of death. There are multiple conflicting reports and even an eyewitness account from a friend claiming to have seen Kurt walking down a busy street three days after he disappeared and getting into a van and driving away. \nhttps://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Kurt_Sova\n\nThe Boys on the Tracks -\nTwo teenagers, Don Henry and Kevin Ives were struck and killed by a freight train on August 23, 1987 in Alexander, Arkansas. While initially blamed on them being high and sleeping on the tracks, it was discovered they were murdered before hand and placed there. There is a ton of corruption and coverups involved with this story to get into, I recommend you look into it for yourself because there‚Äôs a ton of layers to it. One of the most interesting theories is the boys stumbled onto a drug drop operation run by the local police department and were killed for it. \nhttps://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Don_Henry_and_Kevin_Ives\n\nThe Bombing of Flight 21 - \nOne of the lesser known aviation mysteries that has taken a backseat to more famous ones like MH370 is the mysterious terrorist attack that occured on board Canadian Pacific Airlines Flight 21. The domestic flight headed from Vancouver, British Columbia to Whitehorse, Yukon was destroyed by a bomb that exploded on July 8, 1965 near 100 Mile House, British Columbia and killed all 52 people on board. Nobody took accountability for it. Nobody was officially named as a suspect. Either someone covered their tracks really well or were on board the aircraft and killed alongside the others.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Air_Lines_Flight_21\n\nTara Calico -\nWhile on a bike ride on September 23, 1988 in Belen, New Mexico, 19 year old Tara Calico vanished, never to be seen again. There was a disturbing update to this case on June 15, 1989 when a woman discovered a Polaroid photograph in a parking lot in Port St. Joe, Florida of a young woman and a younger boy bound and gagged in the back of a van, the young woman bore a striking resemblance to Tara, who was missing for nine months already. Tara‚Äôs mother believed it was her, Scotland Yard concluded it was Calico based on a scar on her leg, FBI results were inconclusive. \nhttps://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Tara_Calico",

   "message": "I'm from Malaysia, around 2020 Jan, I read an article on Facebook, titled - Bad People Become Old Too. The story goes - 2 kids, boy and girl, and their parent was walking around the street and is going back home, the girl wanted to go back to where they came from to take something, it's stated that back then it's very safe, so the parents let their son walked with their daughter. When the 2 arrived, the boy merely turn his head around, and his sister's gone. The boy ran all the way back to his parents, and the news spread across town, everyone helped looking for her. At the same day, not long after, she was spotted, dead, bruised, and the police found out that she was possibly raped by 8 adolescent/adult, there r 8 bite marks, 4 on each girls arm. What's worst? They piece a long wood down the girls vagina, piecing through her lung, not the ordinary wood, is the wood with iron rose kind of thing wrapped around it. Do u guys know The Rose Crown on Jesus's head when he died, yeah the kind but its metal. That's wat pierced through her body. She had tears, blood all around the floor. She died with her eyes wide open...\n\nIt's estimated that those animals are around 50~60 yrs old now. To this day, we still dk who r the murderers, police even put a bounty price of RM 50k on them. For Malaysians, myb they r sitting next to u on ur way home on Public Transport as u r reading this, myb they r ur friendly uncle next door, myb they r the person who smiles at you everytime u meet them, they r around us, living guilt free life after wat they did to an 8 YRS OLD GIRL",
