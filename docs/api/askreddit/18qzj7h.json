All the girls in my middle school were not afraid to tell him off and be rude to him because of this. I was scared of him too. My dad came to parent teacher night and remembered the art teacher from when he was in school and he said the art teacher was really popular back in his day (but I don't tend to necessarily believe my dad's perception of things). Anyway, the art teacher told my dad he thought I was afraid of men when I first came to his classroom.\n\nThe whole time in middle school I thought people might have been just making it up, because there WERE girls who spread false rumors, it was middle school, and I would know because they spread false rumors about me (I stole one of their boyfriends - which was laughable because most boys thought I was hideous) and wild rumors about other girls. \n\nFast forward 10-11 years later, working as a waitress. I run into my 8th grade English teacher. My shift ends and we get a drink. We get to talking and I ask him about the rumors of the art teacher, they were TRUE. He got in trouble (arrested maybe? can't remember) for stalking a student and the principal at the time would have had to go through so much red tape to get rid of the teacher because he was tenured. By the time I was in middle school, the art teacher was close to retirement and the principal elected to just keep a very close eye on him.\n\nAnd come to think of it, usually students got in trouble for mouthing off to teachers, or at least scolded, but no one EVER got in trouble for disrespecting the art teacher, not even the art teacher scolded them.",

Turns out it was in fact true. I also heard that another girl that went to that same school gave her own brother ‚Äòhead‚Äô too, not sure if it was true but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was.
