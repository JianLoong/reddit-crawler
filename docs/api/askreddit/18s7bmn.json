   "message": "The US healthcare system is actively collapsing. Roughly 15% of US patients **simply cannot receive care**, and that number is increasing.\n\nCOVID accelerated it, but it's been coming for a while. There are tons of causes: cost, patient location, or because of the system being overburdened.\n\n* Hospital systems are closing entire hospitals because they aren't profitable enough. This creates \"care deserts\" where patients don't have access to medical care. Certain specialties are being targeted by politics which can make it worse.\n\n* Hospitals, especially bad ones, are having huge staffing issues. Nurses are leaving bedside nursing at a high rate because patient care sucks. That creates a viscous cycle because then conditions get worse and so even more nurses leave. 35-45% of nurses quit nursing entirely within 5 years. But also MDs, CNAs, and support staff like techs, phlebotomists, therapists, etc leave for the same reason. Hospitals just aren't paying appropriately to be assaulted and shit on and get certifications and have your license be on the line when Target will pay you $2/ more an hour.\n\n* Our insurance system has raised the price of care so high that many patients choose not to seek care, or can't pursue treatment when they need it. That's a combo of for-profit insurance, providers being able to opt out of Medicare/Medicaid (because they need to be profitable to keep their doors open!), and the ever-rising cost of treatment itself (medicine, procedures, AND facilities). States who opt out of extended Medicaid are the ones who need it most, so tons more low-income patients can't afford care.\n\n* The resources we do have are being stretched to the breaking point because of better-known issues like people treating ERs as primary care. That's getting worse for the same reasons: fewer and busier providers, higher costs, worse insurance, fewer facilities.",

   "message": "The US Navy (along with limited assistance from the British and French) has been shooting down dozens of Yemeni Houthi (the Iranian backed quasi government) missiles and drones aimed at neutral shipping in the Red Sea and now well out into the Indian Ocean over the past few weeks.  In mid December, USS Carney engaged more air targets than any ship since WWII.  USS Mason boarded a vessel that had been captured by Somali nationals under Yemeni guidance, rescued the crew and captured the attackers.  The USS Eisenhower Strike Group engaged over a dozen drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles the day after Christmas.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, several ships have been struck by missiles, including an oil tanker which could have led to an ecological catastrophe if the crew had not been able to stay aboard and perform damage control.  (A Norwegian-owned, Indian-crewed vessel bound from Malaysia to Italy). \n\n\nWhatever your thoughts on the Israel/Hamas conflict (and both sides will have a lot to answer for there), the Houthi's claim that their strikes have been against ships traveling to or owned by Israel has become increasingly threadbare as they indiscriminately fire on ships with zero connection to the conflict.  This is Iran stirring the pot and the US has been protecting ships and crews for which it has no responsibility in order to protect innocent sailors and the freedom of the seas.  They have been doing far more than either East Asian nations such as China (despite their base and squadron in Djibouti) or the EU to protect a shipping route that benefits them more than it does us.\n\n\nEDIT:  It's good training and proof that our defenses work reasonably well against at least some targets, but it is expensive and wearing on crews.  We really, really need more help from Europe and China here.  There was big news two weeks ago that a multi-national taskforce would be formed with the US and mostly European vessels (with token support from other nations), but that seems to have fallen apart.  It's been crickets from China, again, despite them having a naval base and squadron in the area specifically tasked for anti-piracy work.\n\n\nEDIT2:  For some related good news:  The UN has completed the unloading of the [FSO Safer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSO_Safer) an offshore, floating oil storage vessel (basically a permanently-moored clapped-out oil tanker that takes in the output of several wells or refineries and stores it for later shipment).  This decrepit ship is moored off the coast of Yemen and has been in legal limbo for years as the various Yemeni factions have refused to guarantee the safety of anyone trying to unload it.  The ship was an ecological time bomb, which could have destroyed the ecosystem of the southern Red Sea if it had sunk, leaked, or caught fire.  \n\n\nIn a burst of surprising usefulness, the UN managed to purchase the ship and its oil, along with an empty tanker.  As of August, they have offloaded the oil.  The ship is still there and will be a mess if it isn't removed before it collapses on itself, but it's no longer the nightmare scenario that it was.",
