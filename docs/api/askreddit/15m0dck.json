My life didn't fall apart and I liked it.\n\nThen some of my friends who were all smart and \"doing well\" in life overall started trying other substances, which at first I was very against, but became more curious when I saw these interesting people having these experiences that seemed compelling. Tried cocaine, MDMA, mushrooms, and benzos all in one weekend and had the time of my life up until that point. I had never felt so free, nor so close to my friends who were doing these substances with me.\n\nA few months later, texted someone I knew looking to get coke or benzos, but was offered heroin instead. Debated this for a bit, but up until this point I'd had zero negative experiences and said fuck it. Tried heroin, was completely underwhelmed, and once again no negative impact. So I kept trying it for the rest of that summer, never having any issues, and I came to believe I was smarter than it and that I had no risk of addiction.\n\nWell, that didn't last forever. I had about 3-4 stints of heroin usage, the first few lasting a few months at a time. The last one went on for almost 2 years before I finally quit and haven't went back and that was quite a few years ago now.\n\nTLDR: Started trying drugs as my friends got into them, had no negative effects, kept pushing my luck and thought I was smarter than addiction and that I was lied to about how drugs work, ended up really liking heroin.",

Eventually, I quit drugs, but my life took a huge dive even though I was 100 percent sober . About a year into sober life, a psychiatrist recommended adderall‚Ä¶.which did help me in some ways, but within a couple years I was abusing that as well. Then I quit that stuff‚Ä¶.was depressed for a very long time. Eventually learned about RC benzos that truly helped my anxiety‚Ä¶.well way too much because I almost died several times over. Again, I dumped that habit and here I am. Sometimes, I wish I had gone to rehab at some point to learn better coping skills.  Im taking it day by day.

To anyone in deep drug addiction, always know you have the power to change , you just have to take control and move on.\n\nEdit mainly started as a mood enhancer.

I was anti drug but almost all of my friends did something. I saw them doing drugs, having a blast and seemingly with no consequences and my curiosity led me to try Cocain and weed. Cobain was amazing and I liked weed too. As I watched friends do all types of drugs and slowly continued to try new things I fucking loved everything I tried and none of the horror stories I had been told all my life ever happened.  Years later I was still able to take opiates and benzos as well as coke, lsd, Molly, ketamine, shrooms, mescaline, and I could go on all night, on the weekends recreational and still be great at my job monday thru Friday. It seemed like everything my parents, teachers and the government said about drugs were flat out lies and lots of them really were. This made me think if they lie about this what else am I missing out on?? Doing a drug Friday night turned into doing everything I could get my hands on all weekend and honestly I think it made life better. 5 years in I was constantly on multiple substances and felt like it reakky made life better, hard times less hard...10 years later a Lyme disease misdiagnoses had me on a regular schedule of opiates and anxiety and otsd had me taking every benzoyl there is at some point regularly. I mean my doctor prescribed it, insurance paid foe it. How could it go wrong. This is where I got in trouble. I realized I could not function wo those drugs and would do anything to make sure I had them at all times. First time I didn't u was so sick I couldn't function which taught me to never let that happen again and it snowballed from there. I needed as much of everything I could get my hands on as I could get. Few years later if I didn't have my opiates, benzos and some lsd, coke and maybe some Molly or k on the side I was absolutely bedridden. Miserably sick and even if I low dosed myself enough to not be physically sick I was seriously psychologically addicted also. I managed to get my shit together some what and I'm a normal working functioning adult but I almost always am doing a small amount of something. I just love the escape. The worry free feeling it gives me. I was lucky I made it out ok. It wasn't easy. It snuck up on me and I hadn't a clue what I was turning into. I still love to get high recreational but I will never allow Myself to be dependent on a substance to surprise. It was miserable my whole life centered around getting my fix. Every minute of every day. I'm so glad I realized that and was able to check myself. It was the hardest shit I have ever done.",
