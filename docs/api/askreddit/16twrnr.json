The fact that men chose to try to conceal having to adjust thier manhood regardless of how pitiful thier attempt at concealing the motion is indicates that the man in question has good manners unlike some trucker dude who stares you ded in the eyes as he nonchalantly swings his hand into his trunks and grips it like changing speed on the gear shift",
