If you're not in the mood to think, you're not likely to enjoy this movie. It doesn't entertain apart from your engagement in the time travel science and mystery. The characters are flat, the camera work isn't especially interesting, the music is serviceable at best, and the dialog is usually technical gibberish sprinkled with real science to create the illusion to legitimacy. \n\nDEFINITELY worth watching if you're in the mood for a movie that you have to solve like a theoretical physics equation. NOT worth watching if that's not your idea of entertainment.",
