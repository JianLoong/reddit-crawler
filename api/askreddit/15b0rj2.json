Intoxication can severely impair a person's motor skills, coordination, and decision-making abilities, making them a danger to themselves and others in such high-risk occupations. Safety is paramount in these jobs, and working under the influence of alcohol would not only jeopardize the worker's life but also pose a significant threat to those around them. Additionally, jobs that require precision and attention to detail, such as surgeons, pilots, or engineers, would also be highly unsuitable to perform while drunk due to the potential for catastrophic consequences.",
