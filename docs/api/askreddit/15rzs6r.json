   "message": "Okay, folks who have problems with inconsiderate boners, here are a few tips and tricks!   \n\n\nStart wearing belts. If you get a boner, you can try tucking it under the belt (might have to wear the belt a bit low for this) or underwear with a very firm elastic waistband strong enough to hold it. This'll hide the shape pretty well.  \n\n\nLong shirts, hoodies, what have you that cover the groin area. Unless you raise your arms way up and it rides up, no one'll see a thing.\n\nPut in mind an image of the late queen of England. She sees what's happening. She doesn't approve. Bonus points for imagining her partially rotted. Her image at all should instantly kill any boner.\n\nWaist bags (aka the frontal/side fanny pack) or anything that sits in that general area that will draw more attention can make it harder for people to notice.   \n\n\nYelling \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?\" and pointing so people turn to look and bolting out the door.  \n\n\nThe trunk monkey.  \n\n\nYou're welcome!",
