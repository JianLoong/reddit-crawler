The church is filled to capacity with guests. We all walk down the aisle and take our places, bridesmaids and groomsmen alike. My soon-to-be SIL is walking down the aisle on her father's arm. My brother is nowhere in sight. There is a long, awkward pause as my SIL is standing in front of a packed church, and we are all just looking at each other. Everyone is assuming the worst that my brother has skipped out at the altar and left her. I'm shout whispering to the Best Man \"where is he\" he says \"IDK\". My mom is nearly having a heart attack. My dad finally gets up goes to the room where my bro was supposed to be waiting and comes out with my brother. My brother says \"Where's the minister, I was waiting on him\". My bro hadn't left at all, the minister was a no-show! He was supposed to be waiting with my bro and walk out with him, or tell him when it was time to walk out while groomsmen were lining up to escort bridesmaids down the aisle. Because no one had checked in on my bro after getting ready no one knew the minister wasn't there. \n\nAt this point, we are all standing in a group at the front of the church; the majority of the church guests still don't know what is going on, just that my bro had to be summoned, and there are angry looks all around. My dad realizes he needs to let them in on what's going on, so he announces to the guests, \"We can't find the pastor, is anyone here licensed?\" of course no one is. The bride's father calls the minister on his cell phone, on speaker so the whole church can hear the conversation. \"Hi Pastor Denny, where are you? Did you forget what today was? Yes Denny, the wedding. The wedding is right now. We are all waiting on you at the church. Ok we'll just wait here then\". Turns out the pastor was playing golf and had put the wedding date down as the following weekend in his planner. I then ask my soon-to-be SIL if she wants us to walk back down the aisle and come back in or what. She says at this point forget it we are all here so we just stand around and wait for Pastor Denny and try to make jokes with the wedding guests but it's pretty awkward as no one really knows what to do. After about 15 minutes Pastor Denny comes running into the church in his golf clothes - polo shirt/funny shorts etc - apologizes and goes immediately into the vows. My poor SIL was furious that day, first thinking my bro had ditched her at the altar then at the fact that the minister had ditched them. LOL. She laughs about it now but it was a tense ceremony.",

Which was fine, by that point we had been to the after party and were back in street clothes anyway. \n\nSo we show up and check in.

They showed us to our room through the steam tunnels under the building. \n\nMy parents and their friends dropped us off, so picture me, my dad, and my dad's buddy walking around utterly fascinated by the behind-the-scenes architecture, while my mom and her friend were mortified. \n\nDad: \"Alan, are you seeing this? Look at how they rerouted the heating system!\" \n\nMom: *face like a slapped ass*.\n\nThe next day we were supposed to have breakfast in the swanky dining room, but they called up and let us know that it had been reserved for the people with the event the night before and could they bring service to our room? That seemed more appealing to us anyway, so we just asked for some fruit and toast. My wife wasn't going to be getting out of the giant soaking bath anytime soon.\n\nI think they flagged us as potentially unhappy campers because several employees showed up with multiple carts of food including an entire loaf of toast, an enormous fruit basket, giant press of coffee, basket*s* of muffins, basket*s* of pastry . . .

   "message": "Posted this before...  \nWent to a wedding that my wife and I said will not last more than two years. The wedding was in the backyard of the bride‚Äôs house. They had all the chairs and wedding \"arch\" setup outside. They setup a plastic tarp running down the aisle to walk on. Just before the wedding starts, there are darkening clouds appearing. Should have been a sign to move the wedding inside, but they invited too many people to the damn thing.  \nJust as they start the wedding, it begins to rain lightly. The father of the bride is walking the bride down the lane and slips on the wet tarp and falls on his ass. Bride is now at the front, raining harder. People start to cover up with whatever they have. Some people start to get up too. Bride turns around and says to all, THIS IS MY WEDDING, NO ONE IS GOING TO RUIN IT, YOU BETTER ALL FUCKING SIT YOUR ASSES DOWN!  \nWe all sit back down and the wedding resumes. It is now raining pretty good. The grass is now turning into mud. A few ladies in the crowd and the bridesmaid‚Äôs makeup is now running down the faces. My wife has taken my jacket as a cover from the rain. They finish the vows and kiss, and then everyone runs to the house and garage to get out of the rain. Oh, remember how I said the grass was now mud? Yea, lots of people slipped and fell in the mud on the way to the house.  \nWe got to the house, many people look terrible from the running makeup, muddy clothing, and soaking wet. A few of the women had to cover their chests and waists due to wet clothing becoming see-thru. Most of the men were loaning their coats to the ladies to cover up. Dirty looks all around.  \nThe wedding cake was outside, and now brought in. The rain made the decorations on the cake turn all runny and it looks horrible. The bride and groom began to cut the cake and feed each other. The smashed the cake pieces into each other‚Äôs faces....then began a food fight with each other. My friend‚Äôs wife got hit in the face with purple icing cake on her face and dress. The priest got hit with and yellow icing on his white robe. There was nothing left of the cake to serve.  \nFood being served was still frozen in the middle of the food and the stuff that was not frozen, was burned. The desert was supped to be the cake, but as said above, there was nothing left. There was a goody bag that people got on the way out. Had a lollipop, a coupon for ice cream cone at McDonald's, a pencil with the bride and groom name on it, and Halloween size M\u0026amp;Ms.  \nMy wife, whose dress was filthy, her makeup was out of whack, and her hair was a mess, said to me that she does not want to see those people again for 6 months she was so mad. The couple divorced 11 months later when the groom came home from work and found his wife getting double teamed by two guys.",

Because for some reason despite already having been together for 5 years at that point, we were like \"we have to get married NOW\" and I truly do not know why. It wasn't even like a religious thing, neither of us are religious, just a dumb teenage brain moment I guess.\n\nAnyway, top awful moments:\n\n\\- Everyone got food poisoning from our cheap cake. Literally everyone. We spent our honeymoon in bed throwing up. I got calls all day from people telling me they were also throwing up. We were too sick to drive home so my brand new brother in law, who had skipped the cake, had to drive several hours to come rescue us from a hotel and take us back home. Truly a nightmare.\n\n\\- Our pictures were all taken by a circa 2012 cell phone and look as terrible as you can imagine, the props were homemade and one was misspelled it was supposed to say \"happily ever after\" but our friend left out the i so it said happly ever after. The shitty cell phone picture of us holding that prop got shared to a wedding shaming group by a guest.\n\n\\- Did not take the time to reserve an actual venue for the reception so we had to do it outside at a campground shelter house because that was all I could manage to book in time. My dress got SOAKED in mud up to the knees.\n\n\\- Did not want to pay a DJ so I had my brother play songs off my phone through a blue tooth speaker, he did not pay attention to the timing during the half assed rehearsal and messed up the bridal entry song and just played some random song from my phone and then abruptly shut it off so there was no bridal entry song.\n\n\\- My mom, who is a raging narcissist, showed up in a neck and back brace and arm sling. She was not injured in any way whatsoever she just wanted more attention than me.\n\n\\- His suit and my dress were both just cheapo off the rack from a big name bridal store that we got at some big sale for like $200 total for both and had zero alterations done so they did not fit right.\n\n\\- Did not want to pay for catering so my father-in-law just made a big pot of chili to serve everyone\n\n\\- Got to my own wedding late because my maid of honor forgot to bring shoes (?) so we had to frantically run to a store and buy shoes for her after our hair appointment and the person in front of us in line was buying a ton of stuff, I was too shy to ask if we could get in front of her and buy our one pair of shoes and go. I also then had to drive back to my apartment, rush to put my dress on, cram myself into my car and drive to the venue.\n\n\\- Left our own wedding early in our suit and dress and got milkshakes at Denny's because we were over the whole wedding thing.\n\nIt was an absolute disaster of a wedding, but we're still married, very happily, 10 years later. We have two kids and a third on the way, we're very literally best friends and we look back on our wedding and we can laugh at it now but we're planning on redoing it at some point because holy hell it was a nightmare, and we aren't broke teenagers anymore.",

Red flag #1.\n\nThey planned to get married in a different state about four months after graduation. Friend moved there to start work soon after graduation,  but fiance said he wanted to stay behind in their grad school apartment for a few more months due to \"work.\" He was a trainer at a gym.  Red flag #2.\n\nShe moved, started her new job,  and continued planning the wedding. Invites went out to classmates far and wide. Everyone booked flights and hotel rooms for a fall wedding. Meanwhile, sketchy fiance stayed behind in the apartment that she was still paying for.  Over the course of the next few months,  he got a huge crucifix tatooed across his back, shoulder to shoulder, neck to waist. I believe she paid for the tat. Remember, she was now working in a graduate professional field and he was a personal trainer at a gym.  He also demanded that she purchase (not rent) a $3,000 tuxedo for him to wear at the wedding.  Red flags #3 and #4.\n\nI'm probably forgetting a few other red flags, but the long and short of it is that, a week before everyone was supposed to fly in from near and far, throughout the country, we all received an email from the maid of honor announcing that the wedding was canceled.\n\nA group of about 10 of us with nonrefundable airfare and hotel rooms decided to make the trip anyway.  The MoH said our friend would love to see us.  So we went, partly so that our preplanned trips didn't go to waste,  partly to comfort our presumably distraught friend.\n\nWe all arrived on different flights on Friday afternoon and met at our friend's house around dinner time.  It was incredibly sad and awkward. The house was packed floor to rafters with decorations, placesettings, tables, folding chairs, and food for a 200-person wedding reception.  Our friend greeted us at the door with a huge smile and whisked us inside, hurriedly past her parents and a dozen other morose relatives who seemed to be drinking themselves into oblivion in the living room. She ushered us into a back room,  closed the door, and quickly explained:\n\n1. Her fiance had been banging a 20 year old girl from his gym.\n\n2. Our friend had been willing to try to \"work things out,\" but he was not apologetic.\n\n3. The night before--less than 24 hours before we had arrived, and just a few days after creepy fiance had revealed everything, passively aggressively aborting the wedding--our friend went to a work happy hour, met a guy at a bar, brought him back to her office,  and had sex with him on her desk. This happened 48 hours before she was supposed to have gotten married.\n\n4. Said guy was on his way to her house at that very moment to join all of us for a fun night out on the town. \n\n5.

The first night there, my maid of honor and her husband went for a walk on the beach. Her husband got a small cut from a seashell on his foot. The next day he was extremely sick, so she took him to the hospital. He got MRSA from the cut and had to be in the hospital for 2 weeks. \n\n2nd night, got evacuated from our hotel in the middle of the night. Someone a few floors up decided to hang their wet bathing suits on the fire sprinklers in their room. It set off the sprinklers and flooded the entire floor and the 2 floors beneath. \n\nThen it's the day of the wedding. The actual ceremony went well. The reception though. Ugh. It was time for the mother/son, father/daughter dance. My husband was dancing with his mom, I was dancing with my brother since my father wasn't talking to me at the time. They called my brother to come up, and he begrudgingly came up. As soon as we start dancing he tells me, \"you disrespected my family. I'd rather be anywhere else right now.\" As to why he did that... we had a head table. I gave my husband's father the list of people who would be there (it was only about 40 people) and him and his girlfriend at the time did the seating and decorated as a surprise. The head table had me, my husband, his 2 groomsmen, and my 2 bridesmaids. Well, my brother's daughter (my niece) also walked down the aisle with my son. Neither my son or my niece had a space at the head table. My brother found it disrespectful that my niece wasn't seated at the head table and it pissed him off.\n\nI immediately go into the bathroom and start crying. My bridesmaids and my husband's mom follow me in there. Then my brother barges in, \"fuck you people! You all don't know shit! She disrespected my family and it's fucking bullshit!\" And storms out. \n\nWhen he storms out, my husband goes to confront him and my brother is like, \"hit me! You think you're a big guy?! Hit me! Do it!!\" But they were pulled apart before anything could happen. My brother then gets in his car and drives off for 10 minutes. I'm crying, my niece is crying, even my husband's brother is crying because he felt bad for me. \n\nEventually my brother comes back, and sends his wife to get me saying he wants to talk. He apologizes and starts crying too. We talk it out for a bit and go back inside. Now the whole vibe is awkward as shit. I tried to have fun, but it put a damper on the whole evening. Didn't eat any food, didn't get to eat any of my wedding cake. We even got cupcakes to freeze for our 1 year anniversary... but someone ended up eating those. \n\nWhen it came time to leave, my husband's brother was supposed to drive us back to the hotel. We couldn't find him at the end of the night, and he wasn't answering his phone, so we ended up getting a ride from my husband's dad's friend who we barely knew. \n\nMy husband's dad and his gf said they would clean up and bring us our decorations and guest book and all that the next day. Well, that night, his dad and his gf ended up getting into a fight and broke up. And she had all of our wedding stuff at her place. So then we had to have an awkward encounter with her to get our stuff back. \n\nThe whole wedding was a clusterfuck, but we are still married 6 years later!\n\nEdit: if anyone wants to get married, either go to the courthouse or go to Vegas and elope.

   "message": "Story from a few years back (+10 years or so), not sure if this counts as 'botched' or not, but here's the story:\n\nMy cousin was getting married, and my gf (now wife) and I went to the wedding ceremony and reception.  It was an Italian wedding (in Toronto, Canada), which typically is an elaborate/expensive affair, with a 5 course meal, fancy chairs and linens, up-lighting, etc., and this wedding had a guest list of 250-300 people.\n\nSomething was off about the day:\n\n1. Bride and the Groom were not happy/smiling\n2. Speeches were short\n3. Families didn't mingle\n4. No father/daughter nor mother/son dance\n5. Other factors, but just a general awkward experience overall\n\nMy gf and I left thinking WTF was that, but whatever, it is what it is. We had given them a generous gift (the \"busta\" with cash),  honoured the family commitments by showing up, and we had thought that was that.\n\n1 month later we learn from the extended family that the marriage was annulled the very next day, as the Bride cheated on the Groom (he found out ahead of the wedding), and they went through with the ceremony/reception because everything already paid already. All gifts were kept by the Bride and Groom.\n\nIt felt like a great big F.U. to all family and friends!",

   "message": "I worked a wedding on patio at a beautiful outdoor historic venue. The bride had antique furniture and decor brought in. The venue suggested to her and her family to get a canopy in case of rain. She said no as they didn‚Äôt have canopies in the late 1800s. Well, her father surprised her the morning of the wedding, by having a large canopy set up anyway. She threw a fit. Canopy was quickly taken down. Dinner was buffet style with an elaborate cheese display, carving stations etc. Wedding was over 200 people. As the bride and groom entered the venue, a downpour! Heavy rains and thunderstorms. Staff had golf size umbrellas and the brides father hung out with me under mine telling me how she ruined her own wedding reception. I felt bad for the elderly as they had no where to go, just sat and was drenched.",

   "message": "TL;DR: Self-cutting and violent assault on elderly father of the bride trying to help.\n\nA couple I knew went to the wedding of one of their good friends. Both of the women in this couple had alcohol and substance use issues. One had depression and one had anger issues. This is all relevant.\n\nDepressed one became a sad drunk that night, locked herself in a stall and stared cutting herself with a broken wine glass. Her angry girlfriend is frantically trying to get her to stop and come out. \n\nQuite a few people were gathered around trying to help and eventually the father of the bride came up and put his hand on my angry friend's shoulder to try to take over with reasoning with the depressed one.\n\nShe absolutely lost it and punched the elderly father of the bride, knocking out at least one tooth, sending him to the floor. People pulled her off of him and she said later that she just kind of lost it and didn't really remember anything after feeling a hand on her shoulder.\n\nShe ended up in lockup overnight, her girlfriend ended up in the ER and then under psychiatric observation (for less than a day), and the bride and the rest of that friend group never spoke to either again.\n\nI stuck a bit longer for some stupid reason, but dropped them both once I realized the woman I was dating was the one I was going to marry. I realized I dreaded the thought of them being there and didn't trust them. We were too close to excuse a non-invite, so I ended the friendships and blocked their phone numbers.",

During the speeches, the couple gets up on the stage to play a wedding game. \n\nGame finishes, and the couple goes backstage to use the stairs back down. Suddenly, there is a loud thud and sound of a broken glass. The groom, wearing formal shoes with a slick sole, slipped while walking down the stairs. While falling, he clutched the glass in his had, causing it to shatter. \n\nI went back stage to have a look. Blood everywhere. Turns out the groom cut his palm open and almost degloved a finger. \n\nAfter getting treated by a guest who was a nurse, the couple had to make their  way to the hospital. During this time was a fun 2 hour period of guests just hanging out and not really doing much. \n\nThe couple eventually comes back, they got to go ahead of the line at the hospital, I think the wedding outfits helped. The groom was only able to stay a bit longer, and had to go home. \n\nWe ended up having a good time regardless it but was such a shame. They got married 2 years prior and were waiting to have their reception once it was more safe from Covid.",

   "message": "went to a wedding in florida. for context: grooms side was a bunch of loud drunks and the bride's father was a cop - multiple uniformed cops at the event and some as guests.\n\nI was dancing with my girlfriend and a few others and when we got back to the table her phone and another were gone. both cases were extremely unique (unlikely taken by accident). it started light enough: checked the table, under the table, around the food. then we chatted with the wedding planner, who was remarkably condescending, and she downplayed the issue and asked the event staff to keep an eye out. still no luck. then we had the singer of the band make an announcement to everyone to please keep an eye out. still nothing.\n\nwe were away from the table for maybe 10 minutes - it was certainly suspect. i went around to every table and asked if anyone had seen the phones and still no luck.\n\nfinal straw was to involve the uniformed officers after about an hour of searching on our own. they were extremely polite and professional, suggested we register the device ID as stolen so that it couldn't be pawned. after that, my girlfriend was very frustrated so we went back to the hotel to see if we could locate the phone on Find My iPhone from her ipad. lo and behold - the phone at the venue, moving around.\n\nwe got in the car and drove back and along the way got a call from her phone and it was some guy absolutely piss drunk, slurring his words. we tried to keep him on the phone but he eventually just hung up. when we got there, the father of the groom had the phone and claimed the drunk guy (an uncle) had \"found it on the floor.\" he absolutely did not, we searched the venue for the hour and were calling the phone incessantly.\n\nonce we got the phone, we left. good riddance. but we found out after we left that the police had approached the drunk uncle who \"found the phone\" and asked him to turn out his pockets and explain why he had the phones even after the announcements and other efforts were made. the grooms father (along with a few others drunks) intervened and got in the cop's face and started yelling at him along the lines of \"how dare you question my family!\" now keep in mind, the bride's father is a lifelong cop. so now it's grooms father against brides father and they start arguing - this argument grows and spills out onto the lawn of the venue. reception was ended as the families were screaming at each other and ultimately went their separate ways for the evening. they had a post-wedding brunch the next day that apparently went over fine so i guess all good for the cops and phone thieves.",

   "message": "Mild story, but I still feel bad for the bride and groom who pretty much had their day mucked up because of it. \n\nWedding was supposed to start at 2:00, and while everyone else was ready the officiant was MIA and radio silent. No one has any clue where they are, if they got into a car accident, etc. etc. They weren‚Äôt answering texts or phone calls and no one else there could perform a marriage ceremony, so the atmosphere was really tense as the bride and groom are together trying to figure out what the fuck to do as everything had been paid for and rescheduling a wedding is hard to do. I *think* some people even had to leave early for work so they weren‚Äôt able to see the ceremony which did eventually happen- at 5:00. \n\nSo the officiant finally shows up three hours late with really no excuse/explanation, bringing their three young kids- who they hadn‚Äôt even ask if they could bring, I think the wedding was childfree- who all have a bag of McDonald‚Äôs food which instead of maybe waiting ten minutes or eating it at the reception hall, ate it noisily in the front row. I‚Äôm talking end of the cup slurping, wrapper crinkles throughout the ceremony/bride walking down the aisle, fighting over toys, interrupting the ceremony to get the officiant to open the toys, loud ass opened mouth chewing. Just *loud*. \n\nThey were also dipping their fingers into the cake frosting, so no one really had any cake. They were just incredibly unruly and the officiant didn‚Äôt try to wrangle them in nor did they apologize for being late, not responding, or bringing them. I think they ate the reception food/cake then left. \n\nIt genuinely felt like they got married by someone who didn‚Äôt think their marriage was going to last so while they technically did the job, it was so‚Ä¶ careless? Like they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to respect that the wedding was important to the bride, groom, and their families/friends. It was shitty and by the end of it the bride and groom were just so incredibly stressed out and trying to figure out how to edit out the sounds of the kids eating during their vows.",

I was all dressed and was doing my makeup when the front desk guy called all the rooms in the wedding block to tell them. I guess a lot of people just found out when they showed up for the ceremony. The couple did not break up and went on to elope a while later, but the bride couldn't handle the stress and was fighting with her parents about how everything was done their way, and just refused to go. Since everything was already paid for their parents said to go ahead and eat and party, but it had a weird atmosphere and everyone left early.

   "message": "I attended a very odd wedding that I could only guess that nobody knew how to plan a wedding, and were given very little time to do it despite the fact the space was rented a year in advance (at least, according to the invites to those who got them).\n\nI was informed of the wedding a few days before: apparently my gf at the time knew about it, but said that she had \"completely forgotten\" until the week of, and only because she saw the bride (a former college friend) had posted on FB about how a lot of guests were \"unresponsive.\"  That was the first hint something was off: a lot of people didn't get the invitation.  And it turned out the invitation was slightly wrong: right venue, wrong room.  When we found the room, it was a function room in the lowest level of the hotel, about two levels below ground, next to the entrance to the parking garage elevators. Just a square function room of the hotel with nothing extra about it.  We got there about 30 minutes before the wedding was supposed to start, and everyone was still putting up decorations with tape and thumbtacks. It was very much like how one decorates a child's birthday party at a VFW, except with adult colors of beige, rose, and gold. Then we had to set up the chairs. There were 100 chairs, and maybe 50 participants. Everything felt last minute and unrehearsed. The bride and groom were helping set up, too. All of this looked like it could have also been done in someone's back yard or rec room, and not sure why a hotel function room was used at all.  maybe for parking?\n\nMany of the guests had mentioned that they only knew about the wedding this week, and some said that they got the first invitation, but heard nothing since then, and wondered if it the wedding was off.  There was scuttlebutt that the bride's younger sister had planned everything, and she was a known flake. \n\nThe ceremony was an hour late because various family were delayed for some random reason, including the preacher. The preacher apparently found out last minute that he was not ordained in the state (Virginia was weird about ordination rules), but the couple managed to get married that week at a local courthouse, so he was largely ceremonial by this point. Then the wedding got started, but the preacher had a soft voice, and people kept shouting, \"we can't hear you!\"  He was one of those people who didn't understand \"we can't hear you\" means to \"talk louder,\" so he'd just repeat himself in the same soft voice.  Thankfully, he was short, and the bride and groom had written their own vows.\n\nIt was at this time I learned they were both poly. I guess, nothing wrong with that, but it was a little surprising, and I got the impression the bride's parents did know or were in denial.  The father of the groom was slightly inebriated, and kept going \"WOO!\" at random points.  The various... other partners also had their vows.  I am sure this was ceremonial, because polygamy is technically illegal in Virginia, but I'm not a cop. \n\nThen the ceremony was over in about 15 minutes, and we were told food had been set up by the caterers on tables by the edge of the room. The cold food (sandwich wraps, mostly) had been delivered, but it was still wrapped up in cling wrap, and we had to help ourselves from foil trays.  There were no tables to sit at, just the chairs, and so we ate off paper plates on our laps. The wedding cake was a sheet cake, still in the Costco box.\n\nThen we were told we had to \"strike down\" because they only had the room for 2 hours. So we all pulled the decorations down, put it all in large trash bags, and that was the end.\n\nIt all felt so... last minute. My gf was in shock about it all, especially the poly part.",
