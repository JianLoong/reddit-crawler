   "message": "Okay, here's how you can use ChatGPT as a tool, and a clear conscience:  \n\n\n1. Create a mind map or brainstorm some key concepts of the assignment. The more material you can produce on your own, the better the rest will be.\n2. Ask ChatGPT something like this: \"If I gave you the instructions for an assignment, and my preliminary thoughts, could you help me create a rough outline for an essay, please?\" (Courtesy costs nothing, be kind to your AI and maybe it'll spill over into your other interactions as well.) Use that to kickstart your writing. \n3. Whenever you get stuck, feed your essay into ChatGPT and ask for places where you could expand or continue. Essentially, ChatGPT will be your catalyst and springboard, and your ladder once you fall into writer's block. A key point, you shouldn't ask the AI to write for you, merely to give you pointers and venues to follow.\n4. Make sure that you write your essay yourself in a separate document. Keep a separate document for ideas and tips given from ChatGPT if you want to.\n5. If you want to use the chatbot to write things, make sure to use its ability to imitate to imitate your own writing style. \"If I gave you three texts written by me, could you emulate my writing style within a given prompt?\" Then feed it three texts that showcase your unique writing style, 500 words each ought to be enough. Then ask it to write whatever it is you wanted. But, again, for the conscience part, make sure to not abuse this since you will not personally recall shit you didn't personally write. So I'd recommend only using this to rephrase clunky parts.\n6. If you are doing this and there is a policy against using ChatGPT, then maybe consider using a different AI to softly circumvent the explicit ban. And if you do, don't do it where there are witnesses unless you want to get in trouble for trying to circumvent a ban.\n\nAI is a tool, and we ought to use it as such.",
