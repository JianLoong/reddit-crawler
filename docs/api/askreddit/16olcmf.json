That's just superficial and I'm just answering the question. Irl I'm not like that. The person inside, regardless of who they are, or gender for that matter, I'm gonna totally be in to them, if they are a good person. Been through enough assholes with nice hands lol 🤙",

We were driving at night down a big hill on a hot summer night and see a young woman running up the hill toward us, really sweating, face purple, and looking pretty haggard huffing and puffing. He made a comment like, “holy shit this girl is struggling.” Got closer, it was her. Long awkward pause. “Well I’m going to have to break up with her” he said.\n\nFast forward 6 months, we run into her at a pub and she is in absolute perfect shape, and when he tries to make a move, she told him aloud, in front of a table full of her friends, “That she wasn’t interested in him, and that he had dumped her for getting fat.” Top 5 funniest takedowns I’ve ever seen.  \n\nFast forward 10 years, he’s been divorced twice and has had a long list of shitty relationships.  The end.",
