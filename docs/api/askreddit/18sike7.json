The windows work, as soon as you hit the water open the windows and get out.  If you wait you don’t know how long or how far you will be under, if the car will be right side up or wedged in rocks.  Just get out right away. \n\nSource: my buddy did his masters thesis on this.\n\nEdit for those interested - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20681239/.
