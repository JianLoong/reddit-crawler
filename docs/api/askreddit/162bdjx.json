The first 6 months were the worst. But when I realized that my senses of taste and smell were coming back, it got a lot easier. I still occasionally have a dream about smoking, but I've always told myself that I was an addict and that one backslide would ruin the whole thing. Never quit quitting.",

This can be a struggle in itself, but focusing on the immense freedom you'll get will help.\n\nPart 2: Accept your habit and don't condemn yourself. Being a smoker does not make you weak no matter what society tells you.\n\nPart 3: Meditation. Or more specifically: \"smoking meditation\". Whenever you're gonna smoke, locate yourself somewhere you won't be distracted or disturbed. Light up and whenever you inhale close your eyes and feel the smoke in reaction with your mouth, throat, lungs, head and the rest of your body. Do this with every inhale of every cigarette.\n\nPart 4: The longer you continue doing part 3, the less you'll actually enjoy it and the easier it will be to realise how ridiculous this habit is. This is when you make the decision to extinguish your last cigarette. Keep in mind that few people succeed on their first try. Quitting smoking should be considered a skill as well as skateboarding.
