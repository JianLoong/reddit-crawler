   "message": "radicalism.\n\nit's like at some point loud masses people stopped being able to be civil, now it's all black and white, us vs them. If someone on other side did something good, it's still bad because i was done by someone who is not with us. If someone on our side is doing some rediculous bullshit, we defend and support it, because at least he is not from other side. Never questioning the leadership, because if you question, you are the enemy. We are actively destroying each other and easily manipulated by leaders who just need to say \"this is the bad guy now\"",
