 "selftext": "My wife pi$$ed her family off and I helped with it! I'm not sure if we are in the right or wrong? (Why I'm posting this) her family has ALWAYS been against her, they gave her, her first car and held the title over her head, they would scream at her and make her do EVERYTHING around the house! Skip to about 2 years later, my wife's family needs a car, we have one we are trying to get rid of but we don't want to get screwed out of the money, so we keep the title. Her family is demanding the title before giving us the payment and we both said no! AITAH for not giving them the title? Because we don't want to lose money??",
