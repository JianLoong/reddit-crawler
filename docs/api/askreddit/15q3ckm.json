I still remember him telling me, “Housing prices only go up, I’ll come out of this way ahead, your mother is being foolish.” This was five minutes before the big housing collapse of 2008. By the time he was finally forced to sell five years later his share was worth about a nickel after having to give my mom half of what the house had been worth five years before. I think about this every time he complains about not having any money, which is basically every time he talks to me.",
