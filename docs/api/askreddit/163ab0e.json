Naturally, they had tactics designed to intimidate ships into surrendering without a fight. But if a ship *did* fight back, or if they were attacked by pirate hunters hired by the governments who wanted them gone. every battle could result in members of the crew dying. Dead crew aren’t easy to replace, so a pirate crew that keeps getting messed up in battle is a crew with a limited shelf life.\n\nHonestly, we’ve seen some discourse on the lives of modern-day pirates, and it doesn’t look good. You’re a criminal in the eyes of the most developed governments of the world. And your main source of income involves risking life and limb, in an age where it’s a lot harder to do a piracy without getting into a fight. The people who still do it don’t really have a lot of options.",

   "message": "What are you going to pirate in the Caribbean? There's not much of value moving between those islands. That's why modern pirates hang out in dense shipping lanes, such as the choke points leading to places like the Suez canal.\n\nSo let's say you go to a dense shipping lane. Due to losing billions to piracy off the horn of Africa, most shipping companies now have a number of defensive measures to protect their ships. I'd like to see the average redditor climb a jumping ladder up the side of a container ship under normal conditions. When was the last time you climbed a 4-story rope ladder on a moving platform? Now add a ship actively trying to evade you, and crew spraying a firehose on your head as you climb (or maybe bullets. Some ships may spray you with bullets instead).\n\nThen let us say you take the ship. You ransom it back to the company. They wait you out until their losses for the shipment minus the insurance payout exceeds your ransom. This is probably months of sitting at anchor. Hope no Navy ships come by in those months. Fun Fact: If that Navy ship is Russian or Chinese, they will post the video of killing all of your asses to social media as a lesson to the next pirates that want to think about seizing a ship under their flag.",
