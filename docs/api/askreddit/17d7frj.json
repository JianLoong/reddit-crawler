That meant that two days out of the week we would be bussed over to the other school. \n\nI sat at the front of the bus while the other 4 members sat in the back (we were all good friends I just like sitting at the front to watch the road) so I got off first and was first to enter the building. The girls team was lined up against wall doing something as I entered and one looked at me and turned to the girl next to her and said \"I thought you said they were cute\" \n\nTo which she replied \"oh they are, he's not\"\n\nOuch lol",
