The owner/manager being mean in both reviews is her.\n\n\"This was our local place (but moved), and now we visit each year while vacationing.   I've always given a great review especially for their staff.  The cook is amazing and the food is always great.  Sadly, this week the tall (kind of reddish color hair)  gal was the rudest I've ever seen any staff member there.  She was so outright nasty to everyone.  Glad that my friend was in a good mood and let it be . . .it wouldn't have been a good vibe.  Also, other staff seemed affected by her MOOD/RUDENESS.  Perhaps next time staff should let her leave if that's how she's going to be.  She's worked their a long time, so not sure what was going on with her.  :-( Perhaps it's time for her to move along to another place?\"\n\n\"If I could give it a minus zero I would.  My sister and I had the spinach quiche with fruit - it tasted a little odd (weird spinach - more like kale or another tough green).  We didn‚Äôt finish it - between fighting off the flies and the taste of the quiche - we finished.  Simultaneously we saw the owner sitting at a table close to us so we asked about the spinach - we said it doesn‚Äôt taste like spinach - what is it?  She said they boil it first - then she said steamed.  We weren‚Äôt impressed with the cleanliness of the patio either.  So we left and went down to the beach for the afternoon.  About an hour later  both my sister had terrible pains in our tummies.  We were on vacation and tried to make it back to our hotel before the dreaded D struck.  We barely made it and spent the rest of our day and night in our room ON THE TOILET.  I called the owner this morning to let her know what happened - and at the very least request a refund.  She not only wasn‚Äôt pleasant - and offered the excuse  that ‚Äúknow one else complained‚Äù - oh that‚Äôs great - that makes me feel better already!  RUN FROM THIS RESTAURANT - it‚Äôs dirty - fly laden and the owner thinks there are so many people passing through town that she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about repeat customers.
