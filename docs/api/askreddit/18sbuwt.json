Enter the \"Screaming Orgasm,\" as it was known locally, which resembled a Toasted Almond except it used Creme de Cacao instead of Kahlua.  It was a shot each of C de C, Amaretto and vodka, filled with half-and-half and shaken over ice in a tall glass.\n\nIt wasn't that it was all that hard to make, albeit it sticky, but more the result of people drinking them that was problematic.  Those who stopped at one were fine but, because it went down like a milkshake, many overdid it.  All that sugar and dairy, on top of whatever other cheap shit they'd been swilling earlier, led to some pretty spectacular drunks and some large, sticky puddles of yack in the bathrooms and parking lot.",

So getting that mix down to serve a single person, is going to take a lot more work than the bartender really will want to bother with.\n\nAlso:  Fun fact.  Cannonball Punch was created to celebrate General Washington visiting Savannah after the Revolutionary War.
