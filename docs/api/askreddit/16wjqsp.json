Just a great all around movie. \n\nThe Autopsy of Jane Doe - Not a super well known one, but one of my favorites. \n\nMidsommar - Just generally unsettling and one of the only horror movies I can think of that takes place almost entirely in a bright, beautiful setting. Also one of the most accurate portrayals of psychedelics ever put on film. \n\nThe VVitch - Super slow burn and incredibly unsettling horror period piece.",
