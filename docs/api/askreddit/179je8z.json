Everyone would rave about her baked goods, but all I could taste was moth balls. She lived in an old house. I think she had moth balls in her cupboards to keep mice away.  It happened the first time, I thought I was imagining it. The second time I tasted it again. Moth balls are poisonous so I had to discreetly spit it out! In later years I had to politely decline her baked goods.",

What does she get?  All sweets.  Those gross super frosted cookies, jelly bellies, random breads with no spread or anything to eat it with, but it was mostly just sweets.

It gets worse instead of buying it like a normal person who doesn‚Äôt know how to make sushi would do she decided to wing it got some salmon from Costco cut it up into bite-size pieces didn‚Äôt cook it at all. And brought it on a floral tray with the skin still on it no rice, cucumber any other thing that one would normally put in a sushi roll just raw skin on salmon chunks in 90¬∞ heat all day, not a single one of those things got eaten.",

A female administrator for public services brought a crock pot of some thick bubbling liquid. It was a grey color. Every pot luck it was the same grey bubbling goo. No one ever knew what it was.   \nforgot one more. Young woman who only wore St. John suits, she told everyone if asked or not. She brought a box of corn flakes.",
