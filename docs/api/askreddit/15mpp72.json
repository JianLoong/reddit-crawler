I am also a citizen of Ukraine and I am very interested in how the opinion about Ukraine has changed now in other countries. I heard that many people are not happy with the fact that the state spends so much money on our support and it would be better if this money were spent on their own state and this is just one example of those that I know.\r  \n\r  \nJust in case, Iâ€™ll clarify, Iâ€™m not complaining, all Ukrainians are immensely grateful to every country, volunteer, everyone who made their efforts to help, but we are all afraid that the West may turn away from us and after that we will definitely be doomed.\r  \n\r  \nYou can also ask me any questions that interest you, I will be happy to answer them.",

I believe he is largely responsible for convincing the west to give aid to your country which improved chance to survive exponentially.  The fact that Russians were so corrupted in training, maintenance, logistics etc., are icing on the cake.\n\nSo long as Putin remain in power, Ukraine will be forced to continue the fight and it will be difficult one to say the least.\n\nAs long as Ukraine remain in the fight, the west will continue to send aid to your battered country and once the fighting stop, to help rebuild and join NATO.",
