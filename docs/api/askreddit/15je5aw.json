When one party doesnt, its time to sever.\"\n\nMy therapist told me this when I explained the relationships I have with two of my friends. With one friend we've wronged each other but we owned up to it and worked it out. This person is my best friend in the world! However, one friend I had would always flake out on me when we'd make plans and then I'd see them on snapchat partying with everyone that wasn't me. On top of that communication with this person was always poor on their end so then I decided I can play that game too. Haven't spoken to them since.",

I told him hypothetically, if it were very important for us to jump very high, and that this had obvious and lasting wide ranging benefits, humans with the trait of a high vertical jump would have a better trait than those humans that could not. His response: But what if they preferred crawling?\n\nThe profundity did not come from the elegant exposure to the truth we crave, but from the jarring whiplash of realization that this person was so impossibly stupid that there wasn't a damned thing I would ever learn from him.",
