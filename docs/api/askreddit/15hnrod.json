It’s such a perfect and long-earned happy ending for them, balanced with the grief of the Doctor and Vicki at losing their company.

The episode about the hunchback of Notre Dame basically asking for a place to stay for the night but he's so ugly that no one would let him in.\nBut Courage let him stay in the barn. Plus he even hung out with and played with the guy. They had fun and genuinely bonded over playing bells and doing acrobatics in the barn. Plus Eustace getting hurt and it being his own damn fault was very much some schadenfreude for me. It taught me \"treat others right and they'll treat you right.\"\n\nBut I just now reread the title and I have to say it would have to be a coin toss between the episode of Band of Brothers called \"Why we fight\" and the second to last episode of The Pacific.\n\nFor Band of Brothers, \"Why we fight\" is about the 101st discovering a Nazi Concentration Camp and their human nature kicking in. Everything in the scene in terms of what they were trying to put across was perfectly performed.\n\nAs for The Pacific episode? Sledge is on Okinawa and he comes across a house that an artillery shell had landed into and killed 2-3 civilians and left a baby orphaned. The sound of a baby crying draws the Marines into the hut where they discover the baby, crying away. A third Marine enters and picks the baby up and carries it off, but thankfully the Marine is showing paternal signs towards the baby. Aka he's gently holding the baby and talking to it as he carried it out. But the really hard hitting part was when Sledge is left all alone in the hut and he hears something in another room. It's a woman who was mortality wounded by the previously mentioned artillery shell. She reaches out to him and grabs the barrel of his Thompson SMG and puts it to her forehead, basically without a word begging him to kill her. Instead he sets his SMG down and comforts the woman as she dies in his arms. I think he cried in that scene. I don't know. But I sure did. He had the opportunity to lose his soul. But his humanity shined through and he gave a dying woman comfort as she died. I'm getting a little teary eyed myself now.",

   "message": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer had an episode called \"The Body\" which had the most significant emotional effect on me. It had an immense impact and made a deep, lasting impression on me. The episode portrayed the raw and devastating reality of death, capturing the pain and grief in a way that resonated deeply with viewers. The absence of background music and the use of long, uninterrupted shots added to the rawness of the episode, making it feel even more authentic. The performances by the cast were exceptional, conveying the complex emotions of loss and mourning with such honesty and vulnerability. The episode's exploration of grief and its portrayal of the characters' different coping mechanisms made it a truly poignant and unforgettable viewing experience.",
