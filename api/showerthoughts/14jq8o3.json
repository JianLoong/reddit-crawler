 "selftext": "The results of our [logo colors vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/14b4z7q/poll_vote_on_fresh_new_colors_for_the/) resulted in \"Garfield Orange #FF8604\" for every layer of the logo. Then, [it was decided](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/14byzzz/poll_showerthoughts_logo_stripes_or_no_stripes/) the logo needed some stripes.\n\nNow we must look within ourselves and choose whether to take the final step.\n\nPlease vote below on whether the Showerthoughts logo should appear [*with*](https://imgur.com/li8Osie) or [*without*](https://imgur.com/MXNTpXa) Garfield's face. Voting will close today at [7:00 pm Pacific Time](https://everytimezone.com/convert/pacific_u_s_/7pm).\n\nThank you.\n\nPS: We have introduced two new flairs: \"Hates Mondays\" and \"Loves Lasagna\".
