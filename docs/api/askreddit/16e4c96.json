Thank you to everyone that took the time to share something and answer my question \u0026lt;3 Feel like I have a much broader perspective on other cultures now. This question came to mind because I recently visited a lovely, elderly couple (family friend) and I experienced some cultural shocks myself. Firstly, their children addressed them by their first names. Secondly they were allowed to wear shoes indoors, even while laying on the couch! I live and have been raised in the UK but I have an asian upbringing (where neither of those things would be commonly tolerated), so witnessing a cultural shock like that really fuelled my curiosity XD",
