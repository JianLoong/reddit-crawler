   "message": "This is so niche, but every time I get on a Mary Queen of Scots reading kick, I get re-obsessed with the [death of Darnley.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Lord_Darnley) It's essentially unsolvable at this point, but everybody involved is acting so weird. \n\nShort version is that Mary and her husband Darnley are in a tense, unhappy marriage. He's staying at a house, she's staying at a castle somewhat nearby. She visits him at one point that night, then leaves to do other social stuff. He stays. The house explodes due to a ton of gunpowder in the cellar that didn't really have a good reason to be there? Mary is fine, she's far from the site. The servant who was still in the house dies, apparently looking like you would expect  somebody to look who was in a giant explosion. Darnley, however, is found dead some distance away, partially dressed and apparently strangled (based on Tudor-era forensics, so who knows). Another servant is found with him and is in similar condition (half naked, strangled). \n\nIt's kind of like the Jon Benet Ramsey case in that there's a lot of theories that explain about 95% of the facts while still leaving a few key elements out to bother you. If Mary knew about the plot, would she have risked visiting the house after it was full of gunpowder? If she didn't, was she supposed to be a target as well? Did Darnley figure something out and make a run for it, or was he in the orchard just because he got thrown there in the explosion, and the people who examined him assumed he was strangled because they hadn't seen many people die from having their internal organs liquified by a huge explosion? Was he half naked because he woke up in the middle of the night and started running, or because explosions can rip clothing off people?\n\nThere were trials and confessions, but they were highly political and the interrogation methods of the time were pretty aggressive. It's all just very strange and complicated and it always sticks in my mind. What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? History could have gone so differently if Darnley had lived or Mary had died that night.",
