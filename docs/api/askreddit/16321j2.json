Or I just don’t know how to eat sushi…probably that. Either I feel like eating sushi seductively would be hard unless it’s smaller sized",

And it was not brief, and it was *detailed*. \n\nSo if you can't find a way to make food consumption seductive you just aren't trying hard enough. \n\nAnd yes, she was visibly appalled by the story. Of course. I couldn't stop laughing, though, so we'll call it a draw.",
