I was reaching over the prep table to clean it and he came up behind me, pressed against me and told me he wanted to bend me over the table and fuck me. I told him if he didn’t get his hands off me, I would cut something off him and get him fired. Then I left immediately and didn’t finish my shift. I told the restaurant manager and he was fired.",

   "message": "On my first deployment to Iraq I was talking to a local interpreter trying to improve my Arabic. While talking about the palace we were in he matter of factly mentioned it was owned by Uday Hussein, and that while working on it one day he'd annoyed Uday in some small way. \n\nUday took his drill from him, had his bodyguards hold him down and started drilling into his ribcage. He lifted his shirt to show me a ragged scarred divot that you could fit a softball in. I heard a ton of stories first hand like this. for instance a volleyball player who tried to get into the Olympics who said Uday would off people or torture them for poor performance. \n\nA friend of mine was on the mission later that killed that guy. Regardless of the stupid reasons we went to Iraq and whatever else happened, I consider the killing of Uday Hussein as a net positive for the world.",
