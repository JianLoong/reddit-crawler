   "message": "There are a lot of very simple answers here that can work, but none of them held for me until I was able to address my emotional connection to food. Why did I emotionally eat? How can I heal that so I have stronger control over my intake ?\n\nI realized that growing up poor my parents celebrated every achievement with food. “You got straight As, let’s get ice cream!” Also, every happy family gathering revolved around a shared meal. It was hard growing up and the times when everything was good always had a food association. \n\nI also had major shame about not finishing my meal. My parents were the type of boomers that said things like “your better clean your plate, there are kids starving in Africa.” I had to learn that it’s okay to NOT finish a meal. I realized that the food is wasted from the moment it enters my house. It’s either going out in the trash or the toilet. I don’t need to be dogmatic about which one. There’s no way I can get my uneaten food to starving kids in Africa, there’s not even a feasible way I can get it to homeless people downtown. Giving budget is giving budget and food budget is food budget whether I eat it all or not. \n\nThere were larger issues with a scarcity mindset I had learned growing up. There were some soothing issues I worked through certain emotional triggers on. \n\nIn the end I haven’t changed what I eat, how I prepare it, or my activity level (I was already pretty active despite my weight). All I changed was addressing emotional eating, giving myself the grace to get over it, and recognizing that it’s totally fine to be hungry sometimes. Portion control got easier and I have more resilience to combat the days when I overdo it with calories. I bounce back the next day/week without shaming myself because I’ve learned some emotional stability. \n\nIf you’re looking to lose weight just take it slow, plan on being patient and resilient. Learn to identify yourself as a healthy, fit individual. Lean into that as part of who you are and what you want out of life, then let that do its work over time. Eventually, if you act like the person you want to be the excess will fall away and all you’ll be left with is what you are. Good luck! I’m rooting for you.",

So, I knew I'd need to restrict my options cold-turkey if I wanted to be successful.\n\nIn addition to tracking every calorie and ensuring I'm in a deficit, I did a keto diet as well as intermittent fasting. By restricting my eating to a specific window of the day I could control my binge eating, or at least trick my brain into thinking I was still doing binges even though I was eating less calories overall. By doing keto I significantly upped my protein intake which helped me feel fuller for longer, making me not feel hungry or the need to binge in the first place.\n\nNone of that stuff would matter if I wasn't in a calorie deficit though.",
