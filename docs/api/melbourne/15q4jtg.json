 "selftext": "My partner and I pay 600pw for a 2bedroom at the far end of Sydney Rd Brunswick. Asking price was 550pw but given the rental crisis we had to ‘outbid’ the others to secure a place. We don’t have a car so depend on the conveniently located public transport options. I understand that the Upfield Sky rail project may kick off any time soon and the Upfield line will remain closed for at least a year at best. This will severely impair our mobility as trams are super slow, amongst other disadvantages.\n\nOur rental agreement is up for renewal in November and we don’t want to continue paying 600pw given the possibility of there not being a train line. What is the best option for us? Do landlords decrease rents in such situations? Especially given the general inflation. The rental value of the property must definitely take a hit in the current circumstances. Can we leverage that?",
