Stayed at this nice little motel but couldnt even smoke there on the property. All of this kept adding up in my head until finally i realized how much of a dependency i had on them for so long. The trip ended up being amazing regardless and with us adventuring around we found places i could have a cigarette every now and again but it never felt the same. And ever since we came back home i tried again to quit. Going a little over a month now with no cigs and i feel so great!",
