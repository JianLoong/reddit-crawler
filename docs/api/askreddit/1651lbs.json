Vulnerability is when you‚Äôre most open to attack, and it fully makes sense why people have learned to not put themselves out there like that. But, I still love it when it happens.",

And that helped because I would have to stop overthinking/obsessing and actually think about what he asked. Always calmed me down. And then if we were walking, he would insist I walk on the inner corner rather than on the side of the road (chivalry) I kid you not he went from a no one to the only one I was interested in! \n\nAlso, he never made me feel dumb if I didn‚Äôt know about something, so I could always ask him anything without feeling anxious. \n\nStill the Sexiest Man I‚Äôve Ever Met.",
