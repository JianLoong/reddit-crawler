I met one fan who has 2k left on her savings and still spent it on a Taylor Swift concert. All her money is gone. And if someone ever make bad comments about her, the fans go bonkers.",

Nooooo! You can‚Äôt do that. It has to be their low fat Whippy bars. \n\nPut on half a pound since last week? You weren‚Äôt following the rules hard enough and now you‚Äôre being shamed in front of everyone. \n\nHonestly, it was such a weird thing to be part of.",
