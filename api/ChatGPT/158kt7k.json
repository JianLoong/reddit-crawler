 "selftext": "Hello there,\n\nI'm excited to share a project I've been working on for the past few weeks!\n\nMy primary goal is to create a service that will be beneficial for people. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!  \n\n\nHere are some key use cases for the service:\n\n* You can dictate a message, which the service will transcribe into text. It then enables the users to send it to any other application with just a one click.\n* The service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.\n* You can dictate an audio message in their native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality—significantly better than Google Translate.\n* The service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.\n\nThank you for taking the time to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: [https://audionotes.ai](https://audionotes.ai/en/?a=r)",
