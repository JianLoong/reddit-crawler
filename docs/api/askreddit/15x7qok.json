   "message": "How the baby boomers screwed them over, and rose-colored glasses when it comes to the so-called \"greatest generation.\"\n\nFirst off, all the shit that people are complaining about was set in motion by the \"Greatest\" generation in the 70s and 80s. Ronald Reagan was not a baby boomer. People need to stop pretending all of the generation that fought in World War II were progressive liberals who loved FDR. The reason things were great in the 50s and 60s and sucked afterwards is pretty much solely because we were an ocean away from where World War II was actually happening. When the dust settled and the war was over, we were pretty much the only country with significant manufacturing capacity left. Our economy skyrocketed and companies were paying union wages because we had pretty much *no competition* in the global market. That all changed in the 70s which was a decade of shit all going wrong at once. When a company has a choice of paying union wages in a rich country or paying starvation wages in a poor one, they're going to pick the latter.  Not saying that there weren't Boomers who did harmful shit to our long-term economic health but it was not solely boomers and it was not all boomers, which leads me to my next point:\n\nNo generation is a monolith. Your anecdotal experience with people of a certain generation does not mean that's the reality of the situation. That applies to when people want to talk shit about Millenials or Boomers, or even Gen Z.\n\nEverybody needs to just stop this \"_____ generation ruined everything!\" talk. It's simplistic, it's lazy, and it's wrong. We'd be a lot better off if people didn't try to reduce every complex issue down to a single, simple cause.",
