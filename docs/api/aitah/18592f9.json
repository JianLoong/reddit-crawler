 "selftext": "*Edit: Hey everyone. Thank you for replying. I should have known but I genuinely wasn’t sure, sorry. I truly apologize to anyone I annoyed with this post.* \n\n*Also they are not abusive, honestly! I think there’s just a lot of stress. Please stop saying they are.*\n\nHey everyone. I hope it’s okay I make this post. (I’m so sorry if this is stupid, I can delete it.) \n\nI’m also using a throwaway account. I remember someone posted a similar question on reddit idk how long ago and I wanted to check those replies, but I can’t find it. \n\nA few weeks ago my parents gave me (17) a monthly payment plan to pay them back for all the years (for like the last 10 years) they’ve raised me, gave me a place to live, and evth \u0026amp;  I’ve been stressed out ever since. \n\n It’s a lot of money and I do have a job, but even then I won’t be able to pay for it or all my money would have to go to it. (And there’s already not so much left because of other things I had to pay.) I won’t be able to move out ever basically. \n\nI am really grateful for everything they have done for me \u0026amp; I know I’m far from perfect, but would it be horrible if I just refuse? Or offer to pay like a part of it? Sorry for this story.",
