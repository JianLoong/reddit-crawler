   "message": "She was unvaccinated and refused to take a covid test before seeing me. My mother was terminally ill and severely immuno-compromised, so I was absolutely trying to minimise the risk of getting covid so I could still see my Mum.\n\n\nShe refused to take a test, twice, despite kind and calm requests and explanations, on the basis that she \"didn't want to get a sinus infection.\" (This was in the time of nasal swabs, not mouth swabs, for covid tests. You know, those nasal swabs that are sterile and can't cause infection.)\n\n\nI'm 100% sure that it wasn't about a sinus infection. It was about control. She had been annoyed because I hadn't validated her anti-vax stance in the past.\n\n\nSimilarly, I know she wanted more validation for her religious views, which she'd acquired in her 30s and which I didn't share. I'd told her that I was happy her faith made her happy, but I think she wanted me to truly share her beliefs. I'd also said that her sister's bisexuality was \"fine with me\" when she'd stated that a wedding of 2 women was \"not what God wants.\"\n\n\nI think all of those different views just threatened the way she saw the world, and how she saw herself.\n\n\nHer last texts thanked me for \"sharing my views\" re covid and it's potential to kill my Mum, then became pseudo-concerned when I didn't reply. I read the whole situation as \"I want to say whatever I want to you, but I want to still feel like a nice person, so please reply and give me that validation.\"\n\nI didn't reply to her, but I still ask myself whether the mature thing to do would have been to clearly reply and state that I didn't want to stay in contact. It's taken me until now (over a year later) to see through the pain and formulate what I might have said.\n\nWe'd been friends since the first days of high school. 20+ years. In essence we just aquired very different views from each other as adults, but I can't pretend her attitude towards my Mum, and towards the horrible journey my family had to take, wasn't devastating.\n\nLife is a bloody painful journey at times, that's for sure.",

   "message": "Was really good friends with this chick for 13 years. She started getting serious with her current boy friend like 3 years ago. She had a stroke and I went to see her. I texted her a week or so after, she never responded. I texted her merry Christmas a few weeks later, she never responded. A few weeks later, I wished her a happy birthday.  She again didn't respond.  I figured she was just going through her typical relationship, where she drops off the face of the earth for a bit and so I have her space.  A year goes by and again, I wish her a happy birthday via text... no response. I figured she just grew apart. Her sister texts me that July saying she doesn't know what happened between my friend and me but asked if I could reach out.  I explained what I've experienced then she stops responding. Two months ago my friend posted a rare snap chat and I messaged her saying I missed her and hope she's alright. She messaged me a few hours later telling me \"you stopped talking to me\". I have a text with time stamp and no reply. I was going to send it to her and try to defend myself but I figured it would just be drama. I've tried reaching out, she never did, but blames me. Frustrating, a little disappointing,  but just dumb. As good of and long of a friendship we had I would think I'd get a friendlier response",

When asked where it went he said it was always his area and he had dibs on it from the beginning.  I didn't argue but really felt disregarded.\n\nMore detail: the \"crazy\" email was a point by point of each random question I had asked in the last few months that Bob didn't like and why it bothered him, followed by how he is the sole \"provider\" in the game that *makes everyone else have fun*.  It included a demand that I make a list of everything I provided to make the game fun for him.  I couldn't even think of how to respond rationally to this (so I didn't).  Who claims to be the center of fun for an online game?\n\nI stupidly tried to call him a couple of times just to discuss it, and he refused to answer his phone.\n\nAnother player (Joe) at first told me not to respond to Bob and ignored it, but eventually over the next couple of weeks prodded me to \"apologize to Bob\" for making him unhappy.  When I asked what exactly I was supposed to apologize for, Joe blew up at me, said I was a liar, had never tried to call him, and was a \"narcissist\" for not apologizing.  I was further baffled. Joe also demanded a screenshot of my phone call log to Bob's number.   Again stupidly, I sent the screenshot proving the calls to Bob.  But I felt really used - it didn't sit right with me, and feeling off for a few days, I banned Joe and Bob from my life.\n\nEventually months later Joe sent me an email saying to \"return to our Discord and we'll pretend it never happened\".  Again, completely baffled.  All this and they want to \"pretend\" they didn't do it? \n\nAnd that is the story of how I ended two friendships at the same time.",

   "message": "I have two. The first one had severe problems with depression, and i had helped her for over six months with coping with this in healthy ways that didn't involve drugs or cutting herself, one particular day on spring break, i was playing fortnite with my brother and our friends when one of them says she went to the hospital. I immediately got worried and started questioning him, and he told me she had posted on her snapchat story \"goodbye\" with her holding a handful of pills and i checked my phone. She did. I tried to call her several times but she wouldn't pick up. That was the first time i had cried for someone in about 5 years at the time. After about a month with no contact, i finally got the story, she had been texting a boy who she knew she was unstable towards, they started arguing, and he mentioned she should end herself. This caused her to have a mental breakdown where she then swallowed the pills. After trying so hard for so long to help her, practically dedicating myself to helping her, she threw it all away. In ten minutes, all that time was for nothing. All for an idiot boy who meant absolutely nothing. Never in my life have I felt so much rage, hate, sadness, and disgust for someone. \n\nThe second one I was also really close with. We had so much in common, and got along great. After about 8 months she started to change, she got distant from everyone and started getting into drugs. Everyday for weeks at a time she came into school drunk, or high off her ass. She was buzzed practically every second of the day, and she only talked to you if she was bored or she wanted something from you. One day she got ahold of a laced weed pen and was using it in the bathroom. She greened out and had an allergic reaction, along with seizures, every teacher and school staff available rushed to the bathroom to help her and she was taken out on a stretcher. When she eventually came back she continued to dabble in alcohol and vape heavily. I couldn't be friends with her anymore after that.\n\nI'm disgusted with myself for knowing i could have stopped them both, had i been more attentive. I still think about these stories often.",

   "message": "So, I (29M) was friends with this guy (28M) for 23 years. We met when I was 5 and he was 4 at a karate dojo, then again in school that same year. We hit it off and were basically inseparable for 10 years. We hung out every weekend, and he lived at my house for the entirety of summer break for 6 of those 10 years. But things changed a bit when we were in high school. I went through a bit of mental and physical health hell, and he (rightfully) started hanging out with other people, got a girlfriend, and joined his school's football team.\n\nThe biggest issue from that point on, was neither of us really had time to hang out anymore. And we eventually just stopped talking to each other. I think we still considered each other as friends, or maybe that was just on my side, who knows lol.\n\nBut to directly answer your question as to what made me end the friendship. I was invited to his wedding... two days before it was supposed to happen... And I didn't even know he was engaged. But I was happy for him, and I still considered him my friend, so I asked what I thought were the appropriate questions.\n\n* What's the dress code? It might be too late to rent a tux, but I can at least have a suit washed and ready to go.\n\nHe told me to just wear jeans 'or something similar'. I thought it was a bit weird, but okay.\n\n* Was there anything they needed for the wedding or a gift that hasn't been given yet?\n\nHe said no, I just needed to be there. (I still gave him an envelope with $500 cash as a wedding gift. I would've felt like shit otherwise.)\n\n* I asked if he would mind if I brought my girlfriend to the wedding.\n\nHe said no, he didn't mind if she came too.\n\nSo, on the day of the wedding, my GF and I showed up in jeans, long sleeve shirts (Hoodie in her case), with an envelope of cash... To a wedding where *everyone* was in what I would call 'formal' attire.\n\nI heard people ask who we were. His mom, a woman who's literally known me since I was 5 and has called me 'son' more times than I can count, didn't want anything to do with me. And every time I tried talking to her, she'd scrunch up her nose and walk away after a few words. And my 'friend' didn't even speak to me the entire time we were there.\n\nThe only bright spot on the day was I got to see his two sisters, who I hadn't seen in a couple of years because they were both busy with school stuff. They were over at my place even more than their brother because my mom was their babysitter growing up, and I'd practically help raise them. Hell, they may not have been blood, but I considered them just as much my sisters as I considered my 'friend' a brother.\n\nMy GF and I sat beside the sisters while their brother got married, I chatted with them for a bit while we ate (my GF who suffers from severe social anxiety just hung out with us), then, when it was time to go, I shook their brother's hand, gave their mom a hug, shook their dad's hand and gave him a hug goodbye.\n\nThat was the last time I considered them my family. The 23 year friendship is over and I don't reply to their (aside from the sisters) messages anymore.",

It just became a ‚Äúlook at me and our lives‚Äù session every the time. Every interaction became so mono-dimensional and boring and we would just nod to the incessant diatribe. I don‚Äôt give a toss about their BIG purchases , I just want to have mates who are just real.",

   "message": "Ah, it was very simple. He was a MAGA supporter and we often talked politics and such. But that wasn't the cause for ending our friendship. I'm quite tolerant and I know how to separate people from their political beliefs. But come the pandemic, he starts promoting anti-vaccine stuff in his facebook. I lost both my in-laws to COVID and he knew that. I tried to convince him to get vaccinated out of concern for him, appealing to reason and empathy. He called me a shill for the pharmaceutical companies, a murderer and a co-conspirator for genocide.\n\nSo, that was the tipping point. I blocked him from all my social networks without any explanation. He can go get lost for all that I care nowadays.",

   "message": "My friend in high school was kinda creepy and had a face to match. (Poor guy) He was very immature and did a lot of childish things and barely passed classes. I don‚Äôt think he has any mental illness but I don‚Äôt know for certain. He was a constant distraction in classes. \n\nBut what was actually concerning was the fact he constantly made school shooting jokes and even bragged about his family owning an AR-15. He showed pictures of it at school and when anyone would ignore his childlike behavior he would threaten to shoot up the school. To put it simply, I eventually stopped interacting with him much but kept a VERY close tabs on him. I‚Äôm glad those years are over.",
