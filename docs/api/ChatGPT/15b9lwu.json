 "selftext": "The increased visibility and use of AI technology, particularly with systems like ChatGPT, has paradoxically diminished the public's optimism about the potential positive impacts of AI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xemms9hixjeb1.png?width=1280\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=f915e842f4ef4c001edbb866aa3f8ec090994889\n\n**Public Perception of AI Has Declined**\n\n* The annual TechPulse report from Steven's Institute of Technology reveals a drop in public positivity towards AI.\n* In 2021, 48% of respondents believed the benefits of AI would outweigh the risks, but this figure dropped to 38% in 2023.\n* This downward trend indicates a 10 percentage points decline in optimism about AI over the past two years.\n\n**Negative Views Spread Across Different Applications of AI**\n\n* People's trust in AI's potential to positively affect areas like personal safety, national security, and personal privacy has also lessened compared to 2021.\n* Worryingly, 25% of the surveyed participants reported that their predominant emotion towards AI is concern.\n\n[Source (ZDnet)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/people-are-more-pessimistic-about-ai-now-than-before-the-boom-a-study-shows/)\n\n**PS:** I run one of the [fastest growing tech/AI newsletter](https://dupple.com/techpresso), which recaps everyday from **50+ media** (The Verge, Tech Crunch…) what you really **don't want to miss** in less than a few minutes.
