   "message": "Hey! I noticed you used an emoji.\n\nI don’t know if you’re new here, so I’ll let you off the hook this time. Using emojis is frowned upon here on this great site, and for good reason. Instagram normies often use them, and you don’t want to be a normie, do you?\n\nIf I catch you using an emoji in the future, I’ll be forced to issue a downvote to your comment. Why should you care, you may ask? Well to begin, you will lose karma on your account, which is a useful social status tool and also a way to show others you know your way around Reddit.\n\nIf you were to continue the use of emojis, I would be forced to privately message you about your slip-up. Any further offenses past that would leave me no other option than to report your account. I don’t think I have to explain why you don’t want that.\n\nBut anyways, no harm done yet! Follow these simple rules and you’ll enjoy your future on Reddit! Have a blessed (and hopefully emoji-free) day, stranger.",

   "message": "I just downvoted your comment.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## What does this mean?\n\nThe amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.\n\n## Why did you do this?\n\nThere are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n• ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, • ⁠Spreading incorrect information, • ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n## Am I banned from the Reddit?\n\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n\n## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n\n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",
