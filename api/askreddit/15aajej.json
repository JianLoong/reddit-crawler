She never tipped, either.\n\nEdit:\n\nOn the flip side, Drew Carey is cool as shit.",

   "message": "George Brett.  When I lived in KC every single time I saw him he was either calling a black person the n word, flipping people off, or trying to assault someone.  He is a huge cocksucker.  Everyone I know or have met in bars has a \"George Brett horror story\" but the media loves him and has him on radio shows and he is the voice of the royals now.  \n\nHere's my best story.  I was a civil engineering inspector a while back and the contractor was replacing asphalt in front of George's house. To inspect asphalt you do a backscatter plot with a highly radioactive device (nuclear density gauge) that is housing cesium 238. It's not dangerous unless the device is broken. Anyway, I park in front of George's house and I'm sitting on his curb waiting for the roller to finish and he comes up behind me and taps my shoulder with a baseball bat.  He tells me to leave or he's going to \"smash my head in like a baseball\".  I told him I was just waiting for the roller to finish.  He then told me to move my truck, which I couldn't due to construction equipment being in front and behind me.  He told me to move it or he will move it for me.  I told him I was sorry and I cannot.  He then took his bat and bashed my windshield (company truck) and the side mirrors and the side windows.  He then said he was going to come do the same to my face.  I grabbed my gauge and walked away.  He ran up to me and grabbed it out of my hand and picked it up and smashed it in the ground about 5 times. Then he hit the shit out it with his baseball bat.  The case was majorly cracked open and you could almost see the element.  He told me to \"not bring my liberal faggot detecting machine around his house again\". Then he went inside.  I called the police, my boss, and the contact for radiation exposure.  The CDC and EPA were contacted and had to show up. A radiation cleaning event took place. Everyone in two blocks was evacuated, all construction was halted for two weeks which meant the road was undrivable for two weeks.  Every person involved had to be scrubbed.  It was a nightmare. It cost the state of Kansas literal millions to fix and the Federal government millions more.  I made a police report against george Brett with the CDC, police, and the EPA.  That was the literal last I heard of it.  The state didn't press charges and the feds didn't care. My company threatened to sue him but he just bought them a new truck and dropped it.  He was solely responsible for a radiation leaking event and should most likely be charged with attempted murder.  Instead he went to Hawaii for two weeks during the evacuation.  I have no idea why everyone loves him.  \n\nMy BFF saw him tell a black waitress at Dave and Buster's, to tell him when his food is done because he doesn't want a \"dirty nigger anywhere near his food\".  Fuck George Brett",

Like dude, just because you have an unhealthy relationship with food and hate the concept of weight control, it doesn't mean you get to decide for the rest of us what we can and can not access. It's not brave or kind of you to act like it's an injustice that some people might like to maintain their body type or, gasp! That diabetics might like to enjoy a treat without having to do extra math to figure out how to adjust their insulin. Especially considering how she sells \"detox\" items, which equate to \"lose calories by going to the bathroom a lot.\" She just wanted attention and didn't care that a business owner's livelihood would be sacrificed.",
