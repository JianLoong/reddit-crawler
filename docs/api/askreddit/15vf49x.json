I bought a used one from a junkyard for $45 bucks, and installed it myself. That went to work as my paper route car. I sold it for $350, and bought my first motorcycle. My Grandfather gave me a 1949 International truck. That took me back and forth to work at a machine shop. I got into the ICT program in high school, half day at school, the other half at work. It also got me a 250 Suzuki, and a 70 dodge truck. Took me to school in Chicago for a year and a half. After that, I started doing construction work with my dad. Also got me a motocrosser, a 125 Hodaka. When I wasn't working, I was riding.\n\nGirls were never though of. I never found one that liked me.",
