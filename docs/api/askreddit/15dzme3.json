This guy was supposed to be someone I was getting along with quite well (the whole group but we were a few being always together). \n\nI was seated chatting with the whole groupe and he came to say that randomly. \n\nI wasn't even interacting with him. Like, he said my name so he could have my attention. \n\nIts like he NEEDED to say it in front of everyone and he didn't feel like he was saying something wrong. \n\nWhat was weird is that, he wasn't even laughing. Its not like someone or some people were trying to make fun of me. \n\nIt was so harsh that people were speechless. No one laughed. At all. I think they were as much confused as I was. \n\nI appreciate no one jumped on that after those \"wtf\" 20 seconds, they all went like nothing happened. \n\nI am 35 and still remember this. Knowing how teenagers can be cruel, I hate this had a huge impact on me but I remember people really tried to not make it a big deal. The group didn't fall into that shit and they were between 15-17 years old. \n\nI think someone even said to the guy \"are you being serious right now??\".\n\nBut I am not sure. I was really trying to swallow the humiliation.\n\nEdit : I posted yesterday my night here just because I felt like to and was not waiting for any answers at all. I woke up and saw your comments and was again confused why so many people gave attention to my post. \n\nThanks for your support. I feel fine today and I know I am cute and most of all nice, funny, loyal and people want to be around me. \n\nBut your biggest weakness being exposed in front of a group when you are a 17 I think is something you never forget.\n\nDon't hesitate to share your story.
