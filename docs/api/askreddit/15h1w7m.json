Things like bending my fingers backwards to touch the back of my hand, touching my arm with my thumb, bending fingers into a Z shape etc.\n\nI was at a party with classmates and this girl I vaguely knew asked me for a private demonstration of my hands. I was slightly buzzed at the time so I said sure and took her to the kitchen while she giggled. I started doing my usual tricks but I quickly noticed something was wrong because she got this disappointed look on her face. She mumbled something akin to \"ok cool\" and left the party claiming she was tired, leaving me confused for the rest of the night.\n\nIt took me 3 days of sobering up before I realized I had fucked up and by the time I saw her again it was too awkward to talk about.",

Jess let me in and let me know that she had to change so I should go up to her room. \n\nI went to the room with her. As Jess undressed, I turned around to be modest. She changed into soffee shorts and a sports bra.\n\nJess suggested we go to the attic to watch a movie on a small tv instead of the living room with the 50 inch Plasma TV because, and I quote, \"Nobody will notice if we make a mess up there.\" \n\nI froze. Jess and I watched The Guardian starring Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher. So, we watched the movie. And we kept watching the movie.

We talked a lot and I liked her but always just thought she was way out of my league.\n\nAbout a week after our prom that year I was telling the teacher about how crappy it was because my date kinda ditched me.  He said \"well why didn't you ask ____?\"  When I told him how I never considered it he laughed at me and was like \"Man, you've been missing a lot of easy signals.  Don't worry, you'll get there.\"\n\nApparently being oblivious was my strong suit.",
