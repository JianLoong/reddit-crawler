   "message": "Not really. 2 points - Stigler's law of eponymy says that no scientific discovery is named for its original discoverer. It doesn't always hold true, but many discoveries are not named after the discoverer. Some examples include: Pythagorean theorem, Occam’s razor, Halley’s comet, Avogadro’s number, Coriolis force, Gresham’s law, Venn diagrams, Hubble’s law.\n\nAlso, it's usually just the last name, so not directly chosen by the parents most of the time.",
