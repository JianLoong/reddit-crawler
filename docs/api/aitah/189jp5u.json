 "selftext": "I'm a Latina (32f) and I'm married to a white man (34m), and we have two sons (7m and 4m). The 4-year-old looks a lot like my husband, while the 7-year-old looks more like me.\n\nI noticed that my husband treats our younger son differently, but he always avoided addressing this issue. My mistake was always avoiding conflicts, and I contributed to that.\n\nWith the younger son, he praises his achievements more, spends more time with him, and even defends him when he does something wrong. Our older son notices this and gets sad, but he tries not to show it. I also feel hurt, but I tried to compensate by giving more attention and affection to my older son.\n\nOne day, I couldn't take it anymore and decided to confront my husband about his favoritism. I told him he was showing favoritism towards our younger son just because he looked like him, and that it is racism.\n\nHe got furious and said I was being crazy and exaggerated. He said I was making things up and that I have no right to accuse him of racism because he is married to me.\n\nNow, we're not talking, and I really can't look at him without feeling angry. AITAH?",
