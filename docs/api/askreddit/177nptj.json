But here' s the thing, up until they hit 50 cents they were at least being honest about it...the candy bar was the same size....then they started doing things...making them thinner...not as thick or wide as they used to be...splitting them in half...but keeping the package size the same, so you didn't notice the increasing gap between the two pieces, and meanwhile the prices escalated while the product was ever shrinking.  So they essentially were robbing you twice, once on the price, and again on the size.  They call it 'shrinkflation' but it's deceptive business practices as far as I can tell.   Anyway, with the average candy bar in a store now costing 2.39 each.  I don't buy them anymore.  Like Ever.  The same for Burger King, and anybody else that thought we didn't notice this.   What are these businesses going to do, when the public as a whole says...ENOUGH!?  I hope they all fail.",
