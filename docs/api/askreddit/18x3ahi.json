I could listen his voice all day on repeat over and over.   \n\nI’m itching to get a record player with some good speakers when I can afford it since I bought a few of his albums as records now. \n\nEDIT:  I forgot to mention he performs as City and Colour if anyone wants to check him out.   He’s also in the metal band Alexisonfire!",
