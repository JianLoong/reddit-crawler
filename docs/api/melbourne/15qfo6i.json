 "selftext": "Hi all, the time has come for me to buy a new suit! Wondering which shops provide the best options, not too keen on polyester blend so 100% wool recommendations would be appreciated üëç\n\nBudget circa $500-700 ideally, it seems like a lot of places have sales running now so that should be achievable. Style is flexible however this will be my single special function suit, not to be worn daily. So black/dark blue/grey with minimal fashion styling but well cut/fitted is probably what I'm aiming for.",
