Today, it might be given a PG-13 rating.\n\n3. **\"Gremlins\" (1984):** Initially rated PG, \"Gremlins\" is a darker and more violent film than some parents anticipated. It played a role in the creation of the PG-13 rating.\n\n4. **\"Back to the Future\" (1985):** Rated PG, the film includes some language and scenes that could be considered edgier than what is typically found in today's PG-rated films.\n\n5. **\"The Karate Kid\" (1984):** Rated PG, this film contains instances of bullying and martial arts violence that might lead to a higher rating if assessed by today's standards.\n\n6. **\"Poltergeist\" (1982):** Originally rated PG, this horror film with intense scenes led to discussions about the appropriateness of certain content for younger audiences, contributing to the eventual introduction of the PG-13 rating.",
