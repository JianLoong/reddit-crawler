By her grimace I could tell she just wanted to get her weed and go tf home and maybe shower after the look he gave her. \n\nMyself, also female, on reception which is essentially babysitting duty for the lobby: “Actually, sir, more than half our clientele are women as are our staff. You must not have been shopping here long.”\n\nGot the dirtiest look and then the door opened for him to finally go back to the main floor. I put a carefully worded note in his profile and she thanked me for responding so she didn’t have to.\n\nListen guys, I’m not saying don’t try, I’m just saying 1. don’t come on so strong, it’s fucking creepy and all of our instincts scream danger 2. if you are covered in weeks of dirt (this dude always had the same stains) take a damn shower. No one wants to touch your dirty ding dong. And 3. don’t use our gender as your topic of flirting. Do better.",
