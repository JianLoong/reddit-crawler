After touring the castle, we stop for pizza just outside the castle and then we start driving back. Im doing my presentation and i feel dizzy again, and then i close my eyes for 10 minutes. I start again and my stomach starts bubbling. I say we need to pull over immediately. Theres only one gas station between us and the exit we need to take, and that one is closed. It takes us 10 minutes from the end of the exit to park in the driveway. I fly out of the car waddling while squeezing as hard as i can. I throw the door open and feel a bit coming out. I sit on the toilet unloading my insides. I see Jesus and Allah at the same time (im indian so i should be seeing niether). A solid 10 minutes later my stomach comes to a rest. I assess the situation and determine that tp is useless. I just hop in the shower and soap up my crack like thrice, everytime is just as dirty as the last. Eventually its clean and i step out to see i have 20 minutes till i have to be there to deliver my presentation. We are racing through the city while im sitting on the side doing my presentation at breakneck speed and we arrive like 10 minutes late. Lucky for me the people im presenting to are still arguing about something and i add more to my presentation. And then i deliver my worst ever presentation to these poor fellows in a language that i was learning for just 5 months. And then i passed out, in tears, on my way back home",

I have pretty amazing sphincter control considering, but I get diarrhea daily and have for most of my adult life. In fact I am currently spraying my toilet bowl while writing this comment. \n\nHere are my top three. \n\n1. In a clean facility for electronics manufacturing. It was a dream tour of mine and I had called in a lot of favors to get there. It takes 15 minutes to get your suit on and decontaminate enough to be in there. I BARELY made it back out in time, but I couldn't complete the tour because I kept having to go. \n\n2. On stage in high school, during a play where I was wearing a difficult to remove costume. One where I was shirtless though and supposed to be a sexy demigod. I managed to hold it until I was off stage, but I missed the final bow. \n\n3. This one is the worst, and probably beats anything in this thread. Underwater while scuba diving about 90 meters under water and requiring at least a 5 minute stop on my way up in order to avoid getting the bends. I had to just shit in the suit, which was particularly gross because it squished up my skintight suit and made it all the way up and around my beard. The fish loved it though and it caused them all to swarm around me like some sort of Disney princess then some barracudas came and scared me, unfortunately not shitless, followed by some sharks.\n\n3b. The diarrhea continued for the next 2 days, including the 2 hour boat ride home. There was no head and we were 15 people crammed shoulder to shoulder in this little boat with my stinking equipment and suit in the boat too. They had to take frequent stops to let me out of the boat to shit again in the water. The sharks were following us.",
