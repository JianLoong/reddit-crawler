 "selftext": "\n\n\n[Old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/xPKymqTU7O)\n\nSo my ex stepsister ran away before she and her mom were supposed to move. She left a note saying she wasn’t going and nobody’s been able to find her. We were all still living at the old house because the new house needed some work done first. Since my ex stepmother had to put off the move to stay and look for her she was still there too and we got into a fight.\n\nMy dad and I ended up staying in a hotel until the work on the new house was done while my brother finished packing stuff at the old house. We’ve finished moving into the new house now and my dad’s isn’t talking to his ex wife except through his lawyer about divorce stuff. My dad doesn’t want me having contact with them at all anymore so I guess that’s it.",
