Just from being born there, you’re imprisoned for life and can never leave. You’re given like 10 haircuts to choose from and the government dictates where you live based on your race. There’s like 3 television channels and websites you’re allowed to go on.\n\nYou’re literally withheld from having any understanding of or connection to the outside world and have the constant looming threat of getting murdered for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Not to mention this man is constantly threatening nuclear war which would destroy the entire world….\n\nEven if his kill count is supposedly less, he is definitely on the same level of evil as Hitler from how many people he tortures.",
