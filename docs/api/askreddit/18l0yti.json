They thrive on a schedule. If you feed your dog every day at the same day, you'll notice they basically get ready for meal time about 15-30 minutes in advance. Dogs also have the brain \"power\" similar to toddlers. Just do basic training and reinforce that training and you'll be fine.",

It is the safest. It is the most sustainable. Climate change has passed its critical point and global warming is irreversible. We need nuclear energy to at least mitigate the catastrophic amounts of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere but anti-nuclear sentiment is so prevalent and potent, this will probably never happen.\n\nEven climate change activists like Greta Thunberg hold strong anti-nuclear energy sentiments and this just goes to show how uninformed, biased, and uneducated people are on nuclear as a renewable energy source.",
