I did. I was diagnosed with GERD 2 years ago, and then had vertigo from sep 2022 for about a year which I still get spells of and no doctor can tell me why. My anxiety went through the roof to the point I went from being \"basically fine\" to needing my medication in order to not genuinely consider a permanent solution.\n\nIt can happen. It sucks and you've gotta put an optimistic spin on it to stay sane, I swear, but it can happen.\n\nEdit 2: yall I'm fine I don't need the suicide helpline üò≠üò≠",
