We secretly got back together in 10th grade and were together through our sophomore year of college. We broke up because it was too hard to see each other and communicate (early 1980s- before cell phones were a thing). Somewhere in the 1990s he sent a Christmas card to my parent's home and we've been exchanging Christmas cards ever since.",
