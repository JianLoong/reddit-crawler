   "message": "When I was a kid, I didn‚Äôt like pooping because I never felt like I was clean enough after wiping my butt. Not sure why really, I wasn‚Äôt ocd or anything but I didn‚Äôt like it; so I decided to stop pooping. Whenever I had to poop, I‚Äôd just hold it or go out and play and eventually the urge would go away. \n\nWell, I woke up in the middle of the night, one night, and I literally couldn‚Äôt breathe. I ran into my parents room and woke them up just gasping for air until I passed out. They rushed me to the hospital and I started being able to breathe again on the ride there. They did some blood work and an x-ray and saw in the x-ray that my colon was so backed up with poo that the poo was blocking my lungs, especially after laying in my bed sleeping for a few hours, which is why I woke up and couldn‚Äôt breathe. My poo impacted colon was basically pushing against my lungs so I couldn‚Äôt inflate them when I tried to breathe in. \n\nThey gave me some ex lax and had to bring in a stool sample for the next couple months, I guess for some sort of testing, but never had a problem after that. I just learned that the poo has to go somewhere so I better get used to pooping. Waking up and not being able to breathe was one of the scariest things I‚Äôve been through",

When it finally snapped I didn‚Äôt think ‚ÄúSHIT! My hip broke!‚Äù I thought ‚ÄúShit! This thing‚Äôs acting up!‚Äù\n\nTurns out the bone was necrotic and released a massive infection into my system, I woke up from a medically induced coma a month later with no idea how I wound up in the hospital.\n\nEdit: Wow, woke up from a nap to see a ton of replies and upvotes! Thanks, everyone!\n\nEdit 2: Just started replying to everyone‚Äôs questions but the gist is this:\n\n1. Prednisone (steroid used for rheumatoid arthritis) is what ruined my hip. I had a doctor who claimed it was ‚Äúsafer‚Äù than the pain meds I was on at the time‚Ä¶I *really* disagree with him after all that. \n\n2. My Dad was the one who called the ambulance a few days after it happened since I passed out from exhaustion (only place I felt remotely comfortable was my PC chair and was stuck there for a whole night, he moved me to the living room couch where I finally got some sleep) and spiked a fever.\n\n3. Doing SO much better now. I got my hip and a few other joints replaced over the next couple years. I‚Äôm still in pain from my rheumatoid arthritis but its a million times more manageable than it was before. Plus I have much more competent doctors who are willing to listen to my concerns instead of the guy who put me on prednisone and said ‚ÄúWhich one of us has the medical degree? Yeah, I thought so, do what I say.‚Äù\n\nIn fact my current pain management doctor told me to stay away from steroids like prednisone completely- They also ruined my bone density, among a couple other problems we‚Äôre hoping to fix or at least manage. He‚Äôs awesome, the total opposite of the guy who put me on prednisone.\n\nThanks, everyone for the replies and upvotes!",

Enema. For anyone who hasn‚Äôt had the pleasure of getting one, they basically shoot a water solution straight up your butt and ask to hold for 10 minutes before you go. I think I held it for maybe 5 before rushing for the bathroom. To this date, that was one of the longest and most painful bout of anal evacuation I‚Äôve ever had.

It was so bad, I stripped off all my clothes and sat in my boxer briefs on my front porch step writhing in agony holding my now bloated stomach.  \n\nMy wife finally took me to the ER and they put an IV in my arm with some pain killer and admitted me for a 23-hour observation. As the night went on, the pain subsided and I finally started feeling better.\n\nFast forward to the morning and I was feeling much better and pretty much back to normal. As the hospital was preparing to discharge me, the night shift was replaced by the daylight shift and a few nurses came in to check on me followed by the new attending ER doctor, a Korean! üò≥\n\nHe was smiling, chuckling and laughing telling me I had suffered from ‚Äúkimchiitis‚Äù and proceeded to lecture me that kimchi is supposed to be a side dish to a meal, and not the main course! I really made his day, and everyone, including my sleep-deprived wife who sat with me the whole night, were laughing,  shaking their heads, and grinning at my stupidity.\n\nTo this day, I still wonder if that Korean ER doctor used my case as one of his funniest ER stories.",

I noticed it in the shower and figured I'd go ahead and pop that.\n\nA few days later, my balls are in extreme pain, I decided that I'd go to a walk in clinic and get checked out. FYI, there is no dignified way to tell someone that you have very sore and very swollen nuts, but I did my best. I go see the doc and show him what's up, he says in an alarmingly concerned tone, \"Oh that is very infected\". He asks what happened and I tell him, he informs me that you should never pop any ingrown hair, but especially in that region, because if it doesn't pop, the infection goes inside. \n\nHe gives me some medication and informs me that I may develop an abscess, and if it does, to come back and he'll drain it.\n\nSo I do the medical regime he prescribed, and it starts to feel mildly better after a couple of days. I get out of the shower and notice that the area has indeed formed an abscess. It looks like a piece of raw chicken skin and I think, I can probably just knock that off and, before I know it, it is off.\n\nBlood. \n\nBut also, no more pain. I'm feeling pretty good about myself, already with a jaunty song in my heart I'm ready to start my day - that is until I see the dime sized hole in my scrotum. \n\nAfter the panic finally subsidies, I realize I can't just put on clothes, as something might get in there. I find a bandage that'll cover it and head to the emergency room.\n\nMuch like telling someone your balls and very sore and swollen, there is no dignified way to tell anyone you have a dime sized hole in your sack. However, fun fact, if you tell someone you have a hole in your scrotum, YOU GO TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE!\n\nSo, I leap frog ahead of a bunch of old ladies to get an ultrasound, all of which are glaring at me. They slather me up and take a look. I asked them if it was twins, they do not laugh.\n\nSo after having my balls handled by no less than 7 people, which is normally a pretty awesome Friday night, I figure I'm patched up enough to go home, but they tell me I have to wait for a urologist. This takes some time and I'm curious as to what they're looking for.\n\nOh. Well, we just want to make sure there are no signs of gangrene or flesh eating disease. Ah. Ok. Uh. Great. \n\nThey check me over, admonish me a few more times for squeezing an in grown hair, and tell me that as long as I take all my meds, I should be alright, which I was. \n\nWorst birthday ever.",

   "message": "Okay this is a little embarrassing but kind of funny now when I look back on it. \n\nMy kid had just started walking and figuring out how to take things apart. We were sitting on the floor and I  heard a thunk on the floor which turned out to be the remote. The back wasn't on and there was a battery missing. I had my eye on my kid the WHOLE entire time but being a first time mom, my mind started to go crazy and I searched for the battery. I searched high and low through the whole entire area of the living room, I'm talking took of couch cushions, knifed open the bottom of the couch, opened pillows, took apart anything that opened ( boxes, cars, blocks, etc) I could not find this battery anywhere. I had just recently read an article about a family who's kid swallowed one of those small circle batteries without them knowing and the child ended up passing away, so you could imagine the amount of sheer panic that started to rise. I went from the living room, to the dining room, to the kitchen, the whole downstairs! I packed my kiddo up, called the ER and let them know the situation and was on my way like a bat out of hell. I was in such a hurry I went in my house slippers and my mom moomoo because I was so scared my kid swallowed said battery. They immediately pull us back, took vitals and calm me down to get the whole story before putting us in a room to take my kid back to do X-rays. We are in the room for less than 5 minutes when I grabbed a paper-towel to wipe the boob sweat I had dripping from my boobs down my belly (I have huge boobs so the sweating was absolutely disgusting at this point) and out fell the missing battery out of my sports bra.. I felt so fucking stupid, but also so relieved that my kid didn't swallow a battery. It was a triple A battery so I thought the chances were pretty low but not being able to find it made me crazy. Everyone in the ER got a good laugh that day and my partner who was away on a job was extremely relieved but also got a good laugh. It took me a long time to tell anyone what had happened because I felt so dumb lol! The hospital was nice enough to not charge us though, so I'm thankful I didn't have a painful cash reminder of how dumb I felt hahaha.",
