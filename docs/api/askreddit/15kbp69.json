She's way more trouble than she's worth. Trust me, you'll save yourself years of heartache and therapy bills.\n\n2. Start taking care of your body, you lazy sack of shit. That metabolism isn't gonna stick around forever. Hit the gym, eat some veggies, and lay off the beer pong tournaments. Your beer gut will thank you.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Don't be so damn hard on yourself. You're not expected to have your life together at 20. Embrace the mistakes, the failures, and the awkward moments. They all lead you to where you need to be.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Invest in Bitcoin. Seriously, just do it. I don't care if you don't understand it. Just put some damn money in it and thank me later.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n5. Lastly, don't be afraid to take risks. Travel, try new things, and step out of your comfort zone. Life's too short to play it safe. And for god's sake, stop using your mom's Netflix account. Get your own shit together, dude.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, that's enough tough love for now. Good luck, young idiot. You're gonna need it. Cheers! üçª",

Stop worrying about work and the apprenticeship, you ace college but that's no reason to not buckle down and learn a bit more while you got the chance and work don't worry your outta there in 3yrs time, you take a break and get a great job with a bunch of great lads and you actually enjoy your job, you also get promoted before your 40 and end up on a  decent pay so stop stressing and worrying.\n(Hated college and didn't take it seriously, I did great there but after I finished wished I had just buckled down a bit more and learnt more while I was there and as for my old job back then Hated that too, the pay was awesome but OMFG was it stressful and hard work, was so happy to be let go from there and although I write about how much I hated it I am soo fucking greatfull for the opportunities they gave me that helped me get to where I am now).\n\n2. Relax a bit more and stop being so uptight trust me if you knew the things I know now you wouldn't people please so much and just enjoy things, people and friends come and go the friends you have now you don't anymore, you have better friends the kind that are there and don't stress you and use you. \n(I always used to people please as I was scared I would end up with no friends).\n\n3. You will meet plenty of women, one will help bring you out of yourself and boost your confidence be good to her, you have so much fun together but unfortunately it doesn't last forever and when your older you realise how important she was to you and wish you had treated her better and kept in touch, don't go being a fool and a walkover for these people Andrea, Denise and Emma I can't go into details as there are things you need to go through in life and unfortunately it includes these 3.\n(Was so scared that I wouldn't meet the right person as I was always shy around women).\n\n4.Finally... Loosen up, relax enjoy life it's going to pass you by, be wise with your money and stop think you'll work it back it takes you forever to get financially sorted again and most importantly spend more time with Mam \u0026amp; Dad you have no idea of how bad you are going to miss them when their gone.\n(As you can see by the above I was very uptight and a nervous wreck right from Comprehensive school up until I would say 40ish, my life hasn't been bad but do wish there were some things I did differently as 99.99% of the population do lol).",
