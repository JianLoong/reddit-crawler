The first times it was really out of accident – we just did it because we were both excited and like I’ve said I have no problems with blood so I went along with it; but then after the first was out of the way – it was something that would be asked of me quite frequently the other times as well, so I figured it might just feel good for them and I always accomodate that need.",
