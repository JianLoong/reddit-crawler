It all got declined, of course, but it was interesting how fast and how varied the charges were. $6.83 here. $22.37 there. They just kept coming (heh) all day long. \n\nSo, yes, it‚Äôs a scam.",

Something to the tune of $100 within the first 10 minutes. Each charge was from a different merchant account with bogus contact info.\n\nFor the next three months they kept hammering it, four or five times a week for roughly $200 each week.

I then burned the card.\n\n\n\n\nAll of that and I didn't even get any access.\n\nAnd for our readers at home, you can do this with privacy.com. It links into your account and lets you create a new card for each merchant, single use if you want, spending limits, and even pause or close the card. It's the only thing I use any more.",

   "message": "I once had a visa gift card that was pretty much empty and I used it when I was like 16 on a few of those sites. \n\nI never got to play a game, every single time it would say ‚Äúyour state requires proof of age‚Äù and it would say I had to send my ID and SSN as proof. I never did that. \n\nI did buy a brazzers membership accidentally when I was 18. I got like the $1 trial and learned that they make it incredibly difficult to cancel your membership, so I was getting charged like $50 a month until I noticed it. (Like 4 months later) \n\nThe website they use to cancel it magically never works. So you have to call, which my anxiety filled ass couldn‚Äôt do, because who wants to call and say ‚Äúhey I want my porn membership canceled‚Äù \n\nI just canceled my card and said the info got stolen and got a new one. It was easier that way. \n\nDuring that time when I was 18 I also spent way too much on onlyfans, and I can say their system is actually much better. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to cancel subscriptions, you can easily take a card off, and I‚Äôve never had my info stolen from it. I don‚Äôt use of anymore as I no longer pay for porn as I‚Äôve gotten smarter finically, but I definitely learned stuff the hard way. \n\nI will say the biggest scam on onlyfans is people saying that a message photo or video is something that it‚Äôs not and charging a shit ton for it. Usually your youtuber turned of models are the worst at this, it‚Äôll always be shit like ‚Äúomg this was my first sex tape, purchase to see me get fucked‚Äù and it‚Äôll be like $75 for a 30 second video of them before they fucked with no nudity. Or people will resell the same video, porn stars are the worst at this. They‚Äôll resell the sad thing but never tell you that it‚Äôs the same so you can purchase the same video multiple times",
