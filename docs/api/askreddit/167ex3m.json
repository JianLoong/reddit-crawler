I don’t know how kind he was personally, but I’d suggest Carl Sagan as one of the…most humanistic people ever. I was mesmerized my Cosmos as a kid, and he popularized science to the world and over and paved the way for many science popularizers today. He also was the person behind the famous photo “The Pale Blue Dot” which to me is the most astonishing and humbling artifact humanity has ever created, given that it was taken by remote control from an enormous distance.",

By the time of his death, Edhi was registered as a parent or guardian of nearly 20,000 adopted children.[7] He is known amongst Pakistanis as the \"Angel of Mercy\" and is considered to be Pakistan's most respected and legendary figure.[3][13] In 2013, The Huffington Post claimed that he might be \"the world's greatest living humanitarian\".[14]\n\n\u0026gt; Since its inception, the Edhi Foundation has rescued over 20,000 abandoned infants, rehabilitated over 50,000 orphans and has trained over 40,000 nurses.[29] It also runs more than 330 welfare centres throughout rural and urban Pakistan that operate as food kitchens, rehabilitation homes, shelters for abandoned women and children, and clinics for the mentally and physically challenged.[30]\n\n\u0026gt; The Edhi Foundation is funded entirely by private donations and full services are offered to people irrespective of ethnicity, religion or status.[31] It runs the world's largest volunteer ambulance service (operating over 1,500 of them) and offers 24-hour emergency services. It also operates free nursing homes, orphanages, clinics, women's shelters and rehabilitation centres for drug addicts and the mentally ill.[32] Outside of its main base of operations in Pakistan, the Edhi Foundation has run relief operations elsewhere in South Asia, in the Middle East, Africa, the Caucasus region, Eastern Europe, and the United States. In 2005, the foundation donated US$100,000 to relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina.[33] As of 2020, the Foundation has international head offices present in the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Australia, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Japan.[34\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Sattar_Edhi",
