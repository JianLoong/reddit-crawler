You add a war in an area where gas/oil is produced, the 4.20 a gallon I pay in the Chicago suburbs isn't that surprising. Rice fields did horrible during rona, and that's one of if not the most eaten food in the world, i'd guess. I don't think we will be getting breaks in grocery stores any time soon either. Summers are getting hotter, and it's not good for crops. We will probably have issues with avian  flu in the future also, so don't expect chicken products to be cheaper.
