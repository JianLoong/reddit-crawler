I did the dumbest thing and took off towards my parents. I caught up to them and they kept me between them the rest of the walk.

   "message": "I was traveling with my 6 year old (at the time son). We stopped in Gatlinburg for the night, at a hotel I had stayed in several times before. Around 3 am, I heard a very loud pounding on my door. I jumped up, ran to the door, opened it, and there was no one there. The hotel was one of those old style hotels where the doors open out onto an open walkway, so I could see in every direction, no one around. I just thought it was some plumbing issue, and was surprised that my son wasn't awakened. I laid back down, and moments later, the pounding occurred again, this time continuing until I opened the door. Still, no one there. I thought that i must be asleep, but I was scared shitless. Still, my son hasn't budged.  At this point, I am sure that I'm wide awake, and I turn on the TV. The Olympics were on, so I was distracted for a few minutes. Then the pounding came again, and as I ran to the door, I could see the door shaking with the force of the strikes. As I grabbed the door handle, the pounding moved to my right, and down the wall, where it ceased. This kind of reassured me of my plumbing theory, so I was actually a little relieved. I laid back in bed, TV and lights still on, my son sound asleep next to me. At this point something bit me under the sheet, on the inside of my right thigh. I threw back the covers, and saw a visible human bite mark on my leg. Obviously, I stayed awake the rest of the night. When we awoke, my son had heard nothing. I met my brother and his two sons, who were staying next door to us, and he asked me what that pounding was last night, so I knew I wasn't dreaming or otherwise hallucinating. I told him what happened and showed him the bite mark on my leg. We packed the car, and left. I have since stayed in this motel again on several occasions, and never had any sort of untoward incident. I have no explanation.",

In the 2nd one lived a rather young couple. I lived in the last one. \n\nMy door opened to a small patio with a stair to go up to the roof, passing a small room in a state of disrepair, to the side there was a door to the terrace.\n\nDirectly under the abandoned room was the kitchen which was connected to the bedrooms via doors, with the bedrooms having no windows but big twin doors that did had windows.\n\nSo one day well past midnight I was thirsty so I went to the kitchen through the patio trying not to bother my sleeping family in the other room. So I open a twin door and I see a canine head looking at me from the room above the kitchen. Thinking that my dog had somehow went through the terrace door I aim my phone camera to use the zoom because it was dark and the room had no outside light.\n\nWhat I see instead is a white dog head seemingly floating, looking at me with empty black eyes from INSIDE the room.\nUntil it moved slightly towards the open window which revealed it had black fur on it's big body. Easily standing 2 meters tall. \n\nI snapped a very bad photo and nopped back to my room.\n\nThis all happened in far less than a minute but felt like years.

I've posted it a few times and I'm just going to copy paste. \n\npara-weird-normal-blog\nThe Stickman Figure Phenomenon\nThe figures have been described as unusually tall, black in appearance, lacking any facial or bodily features and very lean. Their appearances have been documented on message forums and websites since 2008 and often are sighted around dusk or dawn. Reports have had them walking on the sides of roads or in alleys and they seem to follow the unlucky person who witnesses them. \n\nAnother strange thing about these stick figures is that they make no sound and cast no shadow. Rumour also has it that the figures are often charged with some form of electricity (most often reported as static). Source.\n\n\nI had some experiences as a child that I would consider paranormal. After my teenage years I never really opened up about them to people, because of how crazy it sounds. It wasn't until several years ago that I started researching on the internet and found I wasn't alone in seeing these strange creatures. I know it might sound silly to some, but this is what I experienced: When I was growing up I had a best friend who lived down the street. We lived in a quiet, small town where her dad was always working. I would walk to her house everyday after school and we would often take walks, walk to the liquor store to buy candy etc. I would often see a stick man following us, peeking out from behind her coach etc. He was all black and changed sizes. Sometimes the size of a small cat, other times taller than a normal size man. I felt very scared of him and felt he was mischievous at best, perhaps evil, I finally got the courage up to tell my best friend and she admitted to seeing him too. I always got the feeling he was the same one every time, not different stick men. One time he appeared in the shape of a stick figure horse (like a bad child’s drawing.) I always believed him to be somehow following me and watching me. Until, when my best friend passed away suddenly our senior year of high school. She had a genetic heart condition that nobody (including herself) had known about. I’ve never seen what we called “stick man” ever since. I believe now perhaps he was some form of grim reaper awaiting his time to take my friend. I don't know if that's really the case, but it seems odd the sightings of him disappeared after she passed.",

   "message": "More to the “creepy” side than scary, but here we go.\n\nI once saw a prominent anime voice actor in his 50s kissing a fan in an autograph line in a way I wouldn’t kiss my mother. He has had a ton of other allegations of sexual assault and harassment made against him over the years, and I feel stupid that I didn’t believe them until I saw this. There are still people who defend this creep to this day - and I guarantee based off my experience and those of too many others who have worked with this guy - the only ones who do defend him just haven’t been around him long enough.",

   "message": "An orange monster looking thing on all 4s with a gaping mouth. I was never a believer of things like that until I saw it. I’m a 26 year old boring mother who likes reading, watching sitcoms, and baking bread. Nobody believes me when I tell them. I reached out to a paranormal investigator who helped do some research on the big field I saw it in. Turns out it used to be a sacred ground for native Americans and connects to an underground cave system. The native Americans also had a name for a similar creature. I’ll never forget it’s long arms and legs bent at such sharp angles. Or it’s mouth. Fuck.",

I don't like telling the story because people think I'm crazy, but it was one of the most terrifying moments of my life.\n\nI've had dreams about it and I regret more than anything not trying to get proof in that moment.\n\nOh well, I know what I saw and my grippy socks are warm.",
