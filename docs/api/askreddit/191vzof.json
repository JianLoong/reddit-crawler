If you want to sit in silence try doing something (meditate, read, play a game, watch tv). \n\nGo for a walk to clear your head. Think about what‚Äôs literally going on around you not things that have happened in the past. Think about some future goals you have, or plans you have coming up. Keep it moving forward. \n\nThoughts become your habits, so when it does happen just try to stop, don‚Äôt feel guilty about it, and when you snap out of it try to redirect",

You think about how most of the people who society thinks is cool today were more than likely weirdo theatre kids or insecure geeky kids and suddenly I realize I‚Äôve probably had much less embarrassing moments and become grateful that I have irrelevancy in my life that it fades away in at most a day or two  \n\nOr you realize you are the geeky kid and those embarrassing moments make you stronger and it gets easier for things to roll off your back. \n\nEither way ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Nothing is ever that serious.\n\nETA: the other option is to realize that a lot of people are idiots and you also don‚Äôt gaf what they would think of you anyway.",
