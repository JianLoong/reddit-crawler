So you would probably need to change your partner every time your idea of the perfect parnter changes since it is basically inevitable that your idea of perfect will change. Imagine what sort of person that would even be in reality.\n\nRandom tangent , this is making me realize that we seek other people to fulfill our inner wants which even we hide from ourself. Basically we probably want to make our existential dread/ fear of reality (whatever you want to call it) go away by some means and sometimes that means is another person sometimes it maybe our work /achieving something great. This fear is definitely something to meditate on.",
