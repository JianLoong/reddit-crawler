   "message": "I've got a super simple answer for this one:\n\nI googled \"Writing Prompts\" and scrolled down the list a bit :D\n\nA bit more depth, I suppose, comes from me having some experience with Reddit due to the Warframe fandom and D\u0026amp;D, so when I saw a reddit result pop up I thought \"Oh this could be helpful!\"\n\nI'd been trying to get back into writing for a bit and was using various online prompt generators and whatnot to stoke ideas.  Most of them were fairly fleeting or mundane so I just kept going down the list of results until this sub popped up.  The first prompt I saw was about [harvesting giant spider silk](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11ga1le/wp_it_was_a_lucrative_business_spider_silk/) and so I *ran* with it :P  Then I looked at more prompts, found the discord, and the rest is history!\n\n**Summer Challenge Progress (83.26%)**",
