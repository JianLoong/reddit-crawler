 "title": "My sister made a reservation at a hotel for Christmas, told me dogs were allowed. Apparently they aren‚Äôt, I said I wasn‚Äôt going and refused to pay my part. AITAH?",
 "selftext": "My (25F) sister (37F) was excited about going to a nature hotel for Christmas with all our family members included. She sent me pictures of the place, it was a very nice place to stay for Christmas. My boyfriend and I live together and we both have 2 dogs. We‚Äôre leaving our youngest (a border collie) in daycare for those days were going to be gone. But we also have a Golden Retriever who is 3 years old and he has grown to dislike male dogs. He‚Äôs also not used to daycare, and gets separation anxiety when he‚Äôs not with us. Our BC on the other hand is more social and outgoing with others, doesn‚Äôt mind to sleep somewhere else, etc.\n\nThe first thing I asked my sister was if I was allowed to take Noah(our golden.) since there‚Äôs no one of the fam who can take care of him on Christmas, such a special date. \n\nShe said yes, that dogs were allowed. I told her then we were going that it wasn‚Äôt an issue. She made the reservation and had to pay some for us to get the place for that day. She sent me out the link which said dogs are not allowed. I then ask her again, hey are you sure they are allowed? I sent her a screenshot of the part of the link where it said they weren‚Äôt. She again said ‚Äúi‚Äôm sure the owner of the place won‚Äôt say no to us paying him a lot of money just because of a dog‚Äù‚Ä¶ i talked this out with my boyfriend and he said we should confirm with the owner. \n\nI texted him via Whatsapp and he told me that dogs were 100% not allowed. I sent that out to my sister and she says ‚Äúwe see what we‚Äôll do‚Äù. I told her that if Noah can‚Äôt go then we can‚Äôt either. She got angry at me yelling that we had to pay our part because she can not pay for what we were meant to pay. I told her that i was not going to pay a lot of money if we weren‚Äôt going. She said that our dog was our problem and we needed to see how we solved it. That it was up to me to see if dogs were allowed or not. I told her she lied to me and that I was not going to pay, because we were not going. AITA?",
