For example, my parents are happily married for 30+ years and are one of the few couples in their age range that I know of who are in a truly equal and happy marriage with no drama or resentment. They just enjoy each other's company and love their little flaws. They laugh all the time and have a lot of humor. \nWould their relationship have turned out this way if they had become ultra rich in their late 20s/30s?

   "message": "I've actually had this conversation with my mother before, and I wouldn't have to worry too much about trying to convince her. We're very close, and she has always believed me. I'd be in the single digits, so if I suddenly start talking like an adult about investing, buying real estate and her going back to school, she'd know I'm obviously not the young child I was the day before and would take me seriously. Of course there'd be a long conversation after that, and I'd probably sound crazy, but I think as soon as I start talking about what happens to my health in the future, she'd be instantly on it. \n\nI read a lot of those Korean regression/transmigrating novels, so I'd brought up the question to her one day. We had a blast talking about it for a few hours, making up a whole plan and what we'd change, and planning out how to make sure we get our dog again.",
