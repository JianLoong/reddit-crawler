It began back in 2003 or so and aired for 7 or 8 seasons.\n\nThe premise was two 'best friends' who competed against each other and the loser would be humiliated.  Some of the humiliations were awful like brushing your teeth with the toilet brush in the other guys bathroom.  Licking bird poop off a window.  Having to kneel down and lick the door handle to a very seedy sex-shop in downtown Toronto.   Some weren't as bad, like being forced to stand still and pee your pants.\n\nIt's a beloved Canadian show.  Which brings me to my answer.\n\nThere was one episode titled \"Who can piss off more people?\", in it they both try to annoy as many people as possible  One guy pretending to have his car break down in a busy intersection, popping the hood and trying to 'fix' the issue as people yell and honk at him.\n\nHowever the episode ends with something Kenny Hotz does.  Which to this day I cannot believe he managed to do. \n\nHe hired a plane to drag a banner over the City of Toronto for 20 minutes, flying back and forth over the sky.\n\nThe banner simply said\n\nJesus Sucks\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/an-assault-on-christian-sensibilities-ultimately-backfires/article715227/\n\nI'd imagine that doing that over a much heavier Christian suburb in the USA would net you your 1 billion within 10-15 minutes at most.",
