I'm going to guess that this sticks around.\n\nIf you made the right choices from 20-40, being over 40 will go a lot easier. I'm over 50 and made some bad moves when I was young but nothing that has hurt a lot as I've gotten older. I did get cancer last year, which was no fault of mine, but the decisions I made when I was younger impacted how this went. I had a good job, which provided good insurance and good medical leave. I had an emergency fund, which I didn't have to tap. I have a supportive wife with a good job. I'm overweight, which probably didn't help but 18 months later and it's as good as it could be after having cancer.",
