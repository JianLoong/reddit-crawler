 "title": "AITAH for telling my partner he’s being a jerk for leaving me for a month to visit his family in Europe?",
 "selftext": "For context I’m currently pregnant and high risk. When we went for our first ultrasound we asked the doctor about traveling and she said it would be up to us, but there are risks. He was cautious about me flying and said he would prefer if I didn’t for the baby’s sake. I said I didn’t feel comfortable being left alone for a month ( I suffer from depression and anxiety), especially during Christmas and New Years, so we agreed to him going for two weeks and then we could all go once the baby comes. Fast forward a few weeks and he tells me he’s going to be gone for a month and I’m welcome to come if I want, but I’d have to fly out on my own because I have a work obligation the week he’s flying out. I told him I wasn’t ok with that and I felt like I was being abandoned and he was making me decide to either stay stateside and be scared and alone or put the baby at risk and take my first-ever international flight on my own and be terrified for 10 hours that I’m somehow hurting the baby. We had a heated exchange and I told him he was being a jerk for making a unilateral decision to change his travel plans without even consulting me and he said I’m being selfish for keeping him away from his family. He hasn’t spoken to me in nearly three weeks, not even to see how the baby’s doing (we don’t live together). AITAH? ",
