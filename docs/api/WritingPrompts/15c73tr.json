   "message": "\u0026lt;Fantasy\u0026gt;\n\n***Bored to Life***\n\nThe infinite void I found myself in was more disappointing than disquieting.  The fae realm had been so vibrant and full of delights that it was hard for anything to compare.  This afterlife?  It was not beautiful.  It was not ugly.  It was not even terrible.  It was the worst thing imaginable; it was *boring*.\n\n*So this is death?  It's not really as interesting as I would have hoped.*  \n\n\"Hmmm, no, not quite.\"  I did not 'hear' the high voice that spoke so much as feel it.  \"This is more of a waystation.  You are on your way to whatever lies beyond, but I opted to check in with you and see if you wanted to continue.\"\n\n*What?  Are you a guiding angel?*\n\n\"Hahahahahahahahahaaaaaaa!  What an interesting question.  No, I am not here to *bring* you to wherever it is you are going.  I am just offering to *stop* your trip.  My hand is in the stream, keeping you from flowing downriver.  I can push you back up into the pond if you like.\"\n\n*Well...that is a tempting offer.  But I was pretty damn sick and it wasn't a good experience.*\n\n\"Oh dear, sweet human, did you think I would go through all of this effort for you to just die again in five minutes?  Of course, I will remove that which ails you!  You will continue to live for as long as you desire...\"  A pair of bright, red points of light appeared, growing into eyes of burning cinder and flame, \"*If* you agree.\"\n\n---\n\nI felt the cool, welcoming sensation of air filling my lungs.  My eyes opened and, for a moment, the light was blinding.  That moment passed and my surroundings came into focus.  Elina was on her knees by my bed, looking at me with shock through tear-filled eyes.  Just behind her was her friend Ophelia; the pallid elf had one hand on Elina's shoulder and the other was up covering her mouth, looking equally surprised.\n\n\"How is this-\"\n\n\"Sarah!\" Elina all but jumped up off the floor and wrapped her arms around me in a hug.\n\n\"Oof!\" I grunted. Though elves were light as a feather it was still more than my old bones enjoyed being jumped like that.  \"Take it easy dear or you'll squeeze the breath back out of me.\"\n\n\"Oh! Sorry! Sorry! I just...w-we thought...y-you...\"\n\n\"You were dead, Sarah,\" Ophelia's soft voice finished what Elina could not.\n\n\"Oh? I thought I was just sleeping,\" I said with a chuckle.  My lungs were free of the raspy burn from before, and nothing hurt except my neck, which was quickly relieved by shifting in the bed a little, \"Just kidding, just kidding.  I feel *amazing* though.  Whatever you did worked, thank you.\"\n\n\"But I did not administer anything,\" Ophelia said, looking back over at the cauldron she had been working diligently at.  Her brew was still bubbling and steaming.\n\n\"It's a miracle,\" Elina said, and I could not argue.  All I remembered was fading away in pain and feeling tired.  And now I felt *amazing*.\n\n\"It sure is something,\" I said, \"I'm starving though...any chance that medicine you made would go well with dumplings?\"\n\n\"I do not think it wise to administer anything just yet,\" Ophelia said, \"We need to-\"\n\n\"I'll make some dumplings,\" Elina said, cutting Ophelia off, \"Whatever you want Sarah.  Ophelia, thank you so much,\" she gave her friend a hug.  Something in the way Ophelia looked at me over her shoulder made me worry.  How *was* I alive?  My stomach rumbled and I decided that could wait until after snacks.\n\n\\----------------  \nWC: 600/600  \nAll crit/feedback welcome!  \nr/TomesOfTheLitchKing  \nFollow my Summer Challenge progress [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TomesOfTheLitchKing/comments/14c22dj/ot_summer_challenge/)\n\nNotes:  \n- This is a sequel to last week's [Kill Your Darlings \u0026amp; Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/15601hf/comment/jt254ng/?utm_source=reddit\u0026amp;utm_medium=web2x\u0026amp;context=3)",
