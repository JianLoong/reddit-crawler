   "message": "When I was in grad school a friend of mine introduced me to one of his co-workers he'd befriended who was a few years older than us. He was a cool dude and, since we hit it off, he'd often tell our mutual friend to invite me to tag along when they went out for a few beers after work and stuff like that. Since he was older, he was already married and  he'd sometimes mention his daughter, which was totally normal.\n\nAbout a year after I met him he invited my friend and me to a big BBQ at his place and I finally met his family. We had just showed up and we were still saying our hellos when I noticed that the girl I assumed was his wife, who was helping him with the cooking, looked exceedingly young but I thought nothing of it and just assumed she was one of those people who looked way younger than their actual age. Until she called him \"Dad,\" that is.\n\nHe must've noticed my look of utter confusion because he burst out laughing and called her over and introduced her to me as his actual daughter and he later explained to me that he'd had her when he was fifteen years old, and then called over this little boy and introduced him as his grandson. Still laughing he said to me, \"Yeah, she made me a grandpa at thirty years old. What was I gonna do? Be a hypocrite and get mad at her because she got pregnant at the exact same age I got her mom pregnant?\" My mind was blown. Until that moment I'd never thought I'd ever met an actual grandfather who was in his early thirties or that it was something that still happened.\n\nI gotta hand it to the guy, though, he stepped up and took care of his kid since he was a  literal teenager himself and he supported her and taught her to take care of herself and her kid when she became a very young mother herself, and they had a great relationship. He obviously doted on her and she thought there was no better man in the whole world than her dad.\n\nA couple of years later we all got new jobs and moved to different parts of the city and drifted apart though we kept in touch on social media and so on. Some time later I ran into him at some shopping mall with three kids in tow and he explained that his daughter and her BF not only were still together but had actually gotten married and these kids were his grandchildren and he loved going out with them everywhere. He got a kick out of the fact that everybody thought they were his kids and their reactions when the children corrected them and said he was their grandpa. My dude wasn't even forty yet.",

   "message": "Years ago I worked at a daycare center for kids with special needs. I was about 19 and had my own classroom, really loved the job.\n\nOne day a sub showed up to help out in my room. She was ok, her way with the kids wasn‚Äôt my favorite but I did appreciate the extra hands. \n\nOne of the 5 year olds, a child who usually took a lot of time warming up to subs, took to this woman. While they were sitting at a table coloring, the little boy said, ‚Äú I love you Miss Michele!‚Äù This sub, a mom, said to this kid, ‚Äúoh. I don‚Äôt love you. I love MY kids, but I don‚Äôt love you.‚Äù \n\nThis was years ago, but it‚Äôs always stuck with me. No, it wasn‚Äôt something a parent said to me, but it was something a parent said in my presence and I nearly said, ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù Out loud. Those kids, why not just say it back? Jesus. It‚Äôs a small thing, I suppose, but it seemed pointlessly mean, careless. And I can honestly say I did love those kids I worked with the 3.5 years I was there. \n\nYears later when I had my own baby I often thought about the little boy who ventured to tell this person he saw as trustworthy and kind that he loved her  and her response to an innocent child. My hope was that someday when my own went on to school that they‚Äôd feel this safe with a teacher. And if they chose to express that affection, the response would be more positive. \n\nIt‚Äôs ok to say, ‚ÄúWell, I love you, too! I love all my kids in the classroom!‚Äù Even if you don‚Äôt exactly feel it. You could make or break a child‚Äôs confidence for a long time.",
