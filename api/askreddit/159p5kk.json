If I tell them up front my rule and they push for sex those three dates, I know they're gonna be a sex pest. I orgasm with women more, they are more focused on giving pleasure and taking the P in V off the table makes it soooo different and generally better. \n\nWomen are difficult to communicate with. They can be very indirect, they have a tendency to let problems build up until they're almost impossible to solve, and they have higher expectations. It's socially easier with men because they are more go with the flow. \n\nBiphobia manifests as the automatic demand for a threesome with men. It's far worse with women. I've heard the most toxic, slut shaming, misogynistic crap come out of gold star lesbians mouths.",

   "message": "this might be a me problem, but i find it incredibly hard to discern whether a girl is flirting with me or just being friendly. i worry a lot about coming off as creepy and i’m very afraid to misinterpret. i wish i could just confidently approach cute girls, but i’m always afraid they’ll be straight and mortified. that said, it is fun to compliment girls. but i’m always afraid of misinterpreting. \n\nwith men, i don’t have that fear because i reap the benefits of social norms. i find flirting with men to be much more natural as a result. but i’m attracted to so few and far between when it comes to men that i barely do it. i am incredibly selective, whereas i find many, many women attractive. this factor made me think i was a lesbian for a long time because my attraction to men is so incidental. but i still very much am bi. \n\npersonalities i like vary across gender, too. i like girls who are extroverted and more social than me. i tend to be into men who aren’t quiet per se, but don’t feel the need to be the center of attention. i like sweet, gentle men and women who would naturally draw me out of my shell. i also feel that my attraction to women is very superficial, whereas my attraction to men seems to be fueled by personality predominantly. it seems like i’m into a very specific personality type with men. \n\nbiphobia has been a particular torture for me, especially internally. i’ve gone back and forth that i’m straight or gay countless times, but the truth is, my attraction transcends gender. i’ve been like this my entire life. i would stare at pictures of aaron carter and hilary duff. i would get crushes on my boy and girl classmates in elementary school. i used to wish i was one or the other, but these days i feel very lucky to experience life like this.",

Don’t get me wrong, some of them were great guys, and I still talk to a few of them as friends, but it’s exhausting having to act as a second mother of sorts. \n\nAs far as women go, I did have better luck across the board (taking care of themselves, communication, etc.), although my exes and I parted ways on a mutual basis for various reasons (wanted different things in life, things just didn’t work out, all that jazz). The most difficult part though was figuring out whether or not we were flirting or just being friends. It took about a year for my very first gf to figure out that I liked her, and even then, I had to outright say it for her to believe me!",

I appreciate both obviously. With a dude it feels more like a good friend that I have the bonus of being romantic with. With women it’s more like the romantic aspects of the relationship are front stage (which carries its own merit), and we may not have as much in common in terms of what we’re doing when not on dates/fucking/etc, but makes up for that in different ways.\n\nImportant to note that your mileage may vary. I’m not the most experienced person in the world, but this is just what I’ve observed so far…\n\nAlso (as others have said) men tend to be more forward and there’s far less ambiguity.
