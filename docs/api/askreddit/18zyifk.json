And it was miserable. My siblings didn't send any money to help us. And I'd do it again.  \n\n\nI don't think my dad was ever proud of anything I ever did. I don't know.

Blood spurting, adult had to run to get an ambulance (70s, no cell phones) and I sat on the ground holding this kids leg together while trying to talk to him and keep him conscious. After the ambulance came and everyone left, I got up to get on my bike and passed tf out. Courageous only for being able to hang on until they left. Felt like I was in a dream the rest of the day.",
