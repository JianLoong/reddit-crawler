 "selftext": "I (M31) and my wife (F29) have been married for 4 years and have a 3-year-old son. Recently, we visited her brother, who lives in another city, and he showed me their family tree. That's when I discovered that her parents were first cousins. I was shocked and asked my wife later if that was true. She confirmed it and said it wasn't a secret, but it wasn't something she liked to discuss.\n\nI was very upset that she hadn't told me this before. I feel like she withheld important information about her family. I worry about our son potentially having a genetic problem because of this.\n\nShe says I'm overreacting. She says her parents love each other, and there's nothing wrong with their relationship. This statement also caught me off guard. I don't know what to think. I still love my wife, but I can't forget what I discovered and what she said. She tells me to get over it and move on. AITAH?",
