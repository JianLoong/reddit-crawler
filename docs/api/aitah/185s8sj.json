 "selftext": "My German cousin (46f) and her son (21m) flew to Texas from Germany. I was asked by her husband if he got them here to Texas, if I could get them to visit our aunt who is on hospice in South Carolina. Although, this was all a bit unexpected, I said absolutely. So, Saturday last weekend, they flew into Austin. I pick them up from the airport and we head straight for SC. I drove the entire was myself and only pulled over to rest my eyes once for about 3hrs. We arrive to my aunts house and my cousin brings up some concerns about my aunts pets. She also had my “actively dying” aunt crochet her a spiral thing to hang off the car mirror because the ones she had premade didn’t match her car. So my aunt makes it with what little energy she has left. I offered to stay a few more days and left it up to my cousin since the whole trip was to spend time with our aunt before she passes. My cousin didn’t want to stay another day or two, but instead was ready to go. I offered to make a detour so they could see the Florida coast over near Destin. We stayed the night with the plan of hitting the road back to Texas the next morning. Well, the next day comes and they want to hit the outlet stores for some Black Friday shopping. They shop until 4pm and still expected me to drive back to Texas, which I did. I drove 13 hours straight through and getting back to my house at 4:15am. Getting only 3 hours sleep, they wake me up because now they are wanting to also go to the Outlets here in my area about an hour away. So, we get ready, I take them and we don’t get home that day until almost 9pm that night. By now, I’m completely exhausted. Sunday comes and again, they wake me up early for more shopping. I accommodate and take them. Mind you, I’m a teacher and just spend my entire Thanksgiving break driving them around and didn’t even get to spend Thanksgiving with my two kids because I was chauffeuring them around. Now, here’s where 💩 hit the fan… we come home Sunday late evening and one of my two male dogs marked near their luggage but not on the luggage. I’m thinking from them smelling the scent of my aunts dogs??? Anyhow, I don’t spank my dogs but I do talk to them saying “You’re a bad boy! You’re supposed to go peepee outside!” My cousin says, “I don’t know why you’re wasting your time getting on to them because they don’t even know what they did wrong!” I respond with, “They absolutely do know what they did wrong, just look at their faces and how they were sitting there.” She proceeds to argue with me and tells me I can’t tell her anything about dogs. In other words, she’s a know it all. I said listen, they are my dogs and I don’t appreciate you telling me how to raise my own dogs. She starts to get irate and we start heavily arguing. She starts talking crap so I started speaking my mind about the spiral thing my aunt made and how my cousin just wanted to throw it away because she felt it smelled like death. Anyhow, she threatens to hit me. I say go right ahead and you’ll land yourself in an American jail! However, she didn’t hit me and I didn’t call the police. Right after, she said they were looking for flights to get out of here sooner. I said GREAT! Well, there was no flights out on Monday. I decided not to let her stay and continue to use me.  I said she is no longer welcome in my home and that she needed to go stay in a hotel. Would you allow a family member to threaten you in your own home when they are the guest? AITAH? I feel guilty but then again I kinda don’t. I feel she brought it all on herself. I truly tried going out of my way to do all I could for them. I just quickly realized that her true intentions were not to spend time with our dying aunt but instead to spend all of their time here shopping for deals to take back to Germany. Let me also add that I was paying for all gas, meals, and the hotel stay that night in Florida. I truly don’t mind paying. I’ve always been a giver. It’s my love language. I just felt truly taken advantage of and disrespected in my own home. What are your thoughts? AITAH?",
