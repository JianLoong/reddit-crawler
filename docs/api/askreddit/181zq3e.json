   "message": "I live in the Arctic, so I've had to think about this a few times and have a few stories to go with it.   \n\n\nMy first summer here, I got invited to a bonfire at a park (as in territorial park). I missed the pickup time so my friend told me they would set up arrows on the signs in the park to where they would be. \n\nWhen I walked there I saw no signs, and it was my first time there, my friend didn't pick up her phone, so I just followed the road to see if I ran into them.   \nWhile doing this, I got a bit paranoid about how little there would be for me to do if a Polar bear showed up. There's no trees to hide behind, barely any rocks. I would basically be screwed.   \nThere was a hill further ahead, so I decided to go climb it to get a better view on any bonfires, and figured running downhill would be a better option of getting away from a Polar bear.   \n\n\nAs it got dark I saw the bonfires and eventually met up with my friend. I told them about me being paranoid and they laughed at me about being a silly Qallunaat (white guy) and that there's no Polar bears in this area.   \nWell, next day a different friend who was also there that night returned to go fishing, and lo and behold, right were we had been the night before, she found a polar bear footprint.   \nWe had three polar bears in the area that week. One even walked into the city.   \nI haven't had that happen again in the 8 years that have passed.   \n\n\nNews articles:  \n[https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/65674iqaluit\\_bear\\_sighting\\_not\\_that\\_unusual\\_gn\\_official\\_says/](https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/65674iqaluit_bear_sighting_not_that_unusual_gn_official_says/)\n\n  \n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/in-iqaluit-another-polar-bear-spotted-this-time-in-town-1.3155189](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/in-iqaluit-another-polar-bear-spotted-this-time-in-town-1.3155189)  \n\n\nEarlier that same year, a Russian Helicopter Pilot crashed and spent 36 hours on an Ice Floe waiting for rescue. I met him at the local supermarket and he told me that during that time, two bears got on the same ice floe as he did to check him out.  \nHe said he waved his hands and shouted at them and they left.   \nMaybe him telling me this is why I was so paranoid in my first story.   \n\n\nNews Articles:  \n[https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/how-to-survive-on-an-arctic-ice-floe-i-jumped-out-and-lunged-at-the-bear#:\\~:text=Russian%20pilot%20Sergey%20Ananov%2C%2049%2C%20began%20his%20solo,on%20an%20ice%20floe%20for%20over%2030%20hours](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/how-to-survive-on-an-arctic-ice-floe-i-jumped-out-and-lunged-at-the-bear#:~:text=Russian%20pilot%20Sergey%20Ananov%2C%2049%2C%20began%20his%20solo,on%20an%20ice%20floe%20for%20over%2030%20hours).\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sergey-ananov-russian-pilot-rescued-in-arctic-recounts-2-day-ordeal-1.3170235](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sergey-ananov-russian-pilot-rescued-in-arctic-recounts-2-day-ordeal-1.3170235)\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nSo back to the question. Any weapon? Probably some sort of high caliber machine gun or a flamethrower. \n\nIf I was faced in that situation in a more realistic scenario:\n\n1) If there's anywhere to hide like a car or house that I could realistically run to  before the bear gets me, I'd go for that. \n\n2) If I'm out on the land with nowhere to hide, but it's only walking towards me then I'd slowly walk away while taking off pieces of clothing such as mitts, hat, etc. Polar bears are curious and will stop to smell the things you drop, giving you a chance to get away.   \nIf your mitts are made of sealskin they'll likely eat them too. \n\n3) If it's charging at me and already sees me as prey then I would run towards it shouting and flailing my arms, hoping it would think \"WTF is this!?\" and run away instead. \n\n4) If it gets me, I'd try to go for the nose, since I know of two people who managed to scare/fight off Polar bears by punching them in the nose. The chances of it working are very slim, but it's better than just accepting death.",
