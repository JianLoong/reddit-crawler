   "message": "1. Stop using overpriced but actually also extremely bad mainstream razors and buy a good one (e.g. [https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075B43CLH/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_search\\_asin\\_title?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B075B43CLH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;th=1)) and a lifetime supply of actually sharp razor blades for very cheap ([https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B079H1KH5W/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B079H1KH5W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;th=1)).\n2. Once you've learned at which angle and how much force to use (Took me only 3 beard shaves to get comfortable, it's way easier than you might think) you can shave your whole body, especially the private parts, very clean with a way lower risk of cutting or irritating your skin. Despite being sharper, 1 good blade makes it practically impossible to cut yourself (Better control) and even if it happens, the cut is so sharp that it heals within hours and doesn't hurt. You can let that blade glide over your non-stretched balls and don't get cut. I don't use anything but water for my balls, stretch the folds and get baby smooth skin.\n3. For the very densely haired parts, usually the beard but also the upper private area, first trim your hair with a trimmer (5mm or less), this reduces the risk of getting cut, enhances the lifespan of the blade and you are faster because you don't have to clean that much hair off the razor all the time. Use shaving soap or similar and always cut with the direction of hairgrowth.\n4. !!! Profit !!! Best lifehack I have ever found.\n\nEdit: Oh, and those \\~ 10 cent blades actually are also way more durable than the extremely overpriced ones for \\~ 3 bucks. They last at least for 10 shaves or even more. Absolutely a no-brainer, don't get scammed guys and reduce plastic waste :)",
