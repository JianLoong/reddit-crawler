   "message": "Here is a summary and analysis of the Reddit comments on the post \"People that don't use washcloths, how do you wash your privates?\":\n\nThe post sparked a lively debate about the best methods for washing private parts, with strong opinions on both sides. Many users were genuinely surprised that some people don't use washcloths, with one commenting \"I didn't realize people used a washcloth exclusively for this.\" \n\nThe most common methods mentioned were using just soap and hands, or a loofah/shower puff. Reasons for hands-only washing included finding washcloths unhygienic and irritating. Loofah users cited better exfoliation. \n\nSome good insights came from u/CrimsonKepala, who advised against washcloths for vulvas as the skin is too delicate, and u/OneMoreTime63 who explained needing extra scrubbing power to clean off heavy industrial grime at work. \n\nHumorous comments included u/Chairchucker licking privates clean like a cat, u/Metal-Dog having slaves lick them clean, and the creative privates nicknames like \"gennies\", \"glitter garden\" and \"fruit\".\n\nHeated debates arose around cleanliness, with u/rbucket76 calling non-washcloth users \"disgusting\" and u/kylamorris insisting hands don't clean as well as washcloths. u/Smileyrielly12 pushed back that friction from soap and hands removes dirt just fine.\n\nOverall, the community expressed diverse preferences but open-mindedness towards others' methods. Some realized it was a topic they had never thought about before. The discussion reveals how subjects like hygiene have many personal factors like skin type, occupation, gender and cultural background.",
