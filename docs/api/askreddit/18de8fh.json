For Christmas Specials it's the classic 1964 Rankin Bass special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Rudolph's Shiny New Year from 1976.\n\n For non Rankin-Bass examples, it's Annabelle's Wish from 1997, and Olive the other Reindeer from 1999. I remember both specials used to air frequently on both Cartoon Network and Fox during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nFor Christmas Movies, it would have to be \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie\" from 1998. I still own a VHS copy of the movie that I got 20 years ago. My cousin used to own a Rudolph plush based on the 1998 movie which played the famous Rudolph song as his nose was glowing after you pressed a button. Please tell me I'm not the only person who remember that movie?",
