 "selftext": "So long story short. We are in the process of selling our house. It's sold conditionally. Our young daughter has been having issues eating. Today for the first time she opened her mouth to eat food. I was was happy! I also talked to my mom which made me in a good mood and I went for a run. So I was beaming! He walked downstairs and made a big stink how he didn't want me to sing and dance in front of him because we haven't sold the house. He is absolutely miserable. He said that we stillbhave things to do to prepare for the inspection etc. I told him that's fine but I am in a good place right now and I am so happy. I suffer and am suffering currently from pretty severe depression and suicidal ideation. (Goign to the Dr tomorrow to get better meds and be assessed). \n\nAm I the asshole for genuinely being happy for the first time in weeks? Now I'm so miserable I want to cry. \n\nHe's now giving me silent treatment while I'm sitting crying here.\n\n\nEdit: I don't have many close friends that I can talk to, and I needed validation right away to keep me from going crazy. Anyway. We talked and good news he knows that he messed up. I understand that a lot of you say leave etc but he is stressed out and took it out on me. I don't blame him.\n1 of the comments mentioned that I'm probably in bed all day etc.very untrue I workout daily, cook, clean ( I'm a neat freak) and have 3 kids too look after. \nAt the end of the day he is human too and makes mistakes. We are not perfect but I know he is trying and I am trying too. \nHappy ending ❤️ ",
