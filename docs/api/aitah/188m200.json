 "selftext": "We (60M) and Her (53F)have only been married for 10 years. I have been struggling with prostate issues along with ED issues for about 4 years. Have tried ED meds while viagra works well for ED it gives me migraines that last for a couple days . Cialis daily has worked but had to change health insurance and Drs because of insurance change and have been fighting with to get daily prescribed again. So have went 6 months without it and thus no sex. Wife said that this is not acceptable that the limited sex has taken toll. She says that her needs are not being met and it‚Äôs either open marriage so she can get those needs taken care of or divorce. I told her that she is being cruel and that I have been doing what can and that I miss it as well. That was a few days ago and have decided rather divorce than be made a cuckold. Am I being unreasonable?",
