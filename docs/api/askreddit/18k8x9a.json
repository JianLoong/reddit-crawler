Its a hard change for sure, but you start to realize you just become crazy and in your head if you don’t get it over with. You exhaust yourself trying to visualize every possibility and outcome.\n\nThey say “fall” in love for a reason. At some point someone has to “fall”. Oftentimes you get so caught up in the feelings trenches that you overthink the consequences. \n\nYou project your own passion onto them, so if it doesn’t work you automatically assume this spectacular disaster that is completely made up.\n\nSometimes its ok to be bold. Yeah life isnt a movie, but we need to be the person we keep wishing for.\n\nGo for it, its better than lingering in the awful “what ifs”\n\nYeah it will hurt if it doesnt go your way, but do you want to get it over with and move past it, or linger in the potential pain for ages?",

Lost any contact with them since pandemic struck. So all that's left is going around approaching as many random girls as i can in a quasi-robotic, quasi-military way until someone begins wondering what i'm up to.\n\nSo now i'm on my own, living with my mother and sister and doing deliveries all day as a contractor (sort of DoorDash). That's why talking to random people all the time ain't a problem for me, i do it all the time with no real connection (can't bother clients and barmen/staff or i risk loosing my job).\n\nCan move out anytime, but if it just results in staying single and eventually ending my funds and having to go back with my mother and sister, then it's pointless. At least i'm saving money now. Eventually i'll get rich enough that pausing my life and focusing on obsessively looking for a partner won't be a problem for a long enough time.\n\nSex? The occasional escort, since it's legal where i live. That's why getting rejected all the time, getting told \"already have a boyfriend\" by 100 different girls, ain't a problem for me.\n\nThe only problem is being 30 and not growing up. Being stuck in a rut where all i fear is not making any progress with my life, only losing money and going backwards. I'm looking after saving a considerable sum before beginning actively looking for a partner.\n\nMother uninterested in me being 30 and alone. Father lost early on when i was 14. I'm on my motherfucking own.\n\nIn short, Para bellum, they say. Prepare for war. \n\nBecause at 30 with no more friends and a broken family, looking for a partner is almost like waging a war on someone. \n\n\"Hi there. Wonderful weather today. Yadda yadda yadda... wanna go out\" \"Already have a boyfriend sorry\" \"Oh well have a nice day. And you over there, yadda yadda yadda, wanna go out? Have a boyfriend too? Oh well excuse me\" \"You're her boyfriend? Sorry, i thought you were her friend or something\".\n\nAll day each and every day like that.",
