   "message": "I felt the soft, cold sand at my feet as I walked down the dark beach. I thought it was strange no one else had come to watch the sunrise, the only sounds were the soft crashing of waves and the wind whistling in my ear. Not that I was complaining about having the beach all to myself.\n\nI checked my watch, 6 in the morning. I found it strange that I still saw no signs of the sun peaking over the horizon, despite it being 15 minutes past the time my phone said I could expect sunrise. \n\nNonetheless, I enjoyed the moment. I felt strangely at peace, despite the dark environment. I continued walking, thinking I either looked at the wrong date or my phone was just off a few minutes.\n\nStrangely, and the minutes ticked by, it didnâ€™t get brighter. In fact, it only got darker.\n\nEven then, I kept walking. It felt like the more I walked, the more peaceful it felt.\n\nSoon I forgot why I was even there in the first place.\n\nThen, without even realizing it, I slowly forgot who I was.",
