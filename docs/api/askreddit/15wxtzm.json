I would never fight back because my mentality was, “well, I would never treat someone this way unless they’d done something awful, so I must deserve this”. It took me until my 30’s to realize that all those people *started* abusing me because of their crabs in the bucket mentality, and *continued* because they realized I wouldn’t do anything to stop them. It had nothing to do with me being bad or subpar in any way, quite the opposite, actually!\n\nThere’s nothing you can do to prevent or cause an abuser’s or bully’s behaviour, we are all responsible for OUR OWN behaviour only, and that includes learning to stand up for ourselves!",
