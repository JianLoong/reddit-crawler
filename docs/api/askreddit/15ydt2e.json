I'm taking my GF to Spain for two weeks and then spending a few days in Italy before we come back.\"\n\nHe got real upset when I asked him where he was gonna work when he came back. Apparently he didn't understand that taking 3 weeks vacation not even two months into a job isn't a thing, especially when part of that was during our busiest season of the year.\n\nEven better when we all looked at him and told him we couldn't even afford a week off, let alone in Spain.\n\nHe didn't last long.",

   "message": "When we had been married for less than a year my grandparents told us that the best way to get ahead is buy a house and pay it off quickly. If possible in less than five years. Together we were making about $20,000 a year in 2012. Most of my extended family did very well for themselves and are incredibly nice but say things like this occasionally. My friend that isn't rich but is financially comfortable told me that whenever he gets real stressed at home he just goes and stays in a local hotel room by himself for the weekend and that I should try that. We can barely afford to stay in a hotel overnight maybe once a year. Realistically we shouldn't even do that but we just fall behind on bills for a couple months so that we can get away for a night or two every year. Our vacation \"budget\" is maybe  $500 to $600 a year and again by \"budget\" I mean we fall behind on bills for awhile. We have a family of four on about $60,000 year.",
