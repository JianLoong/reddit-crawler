   "message": "Here's the thing: Hydrogen is unbelievably common. Its estimated that 75% of all matter in the Universe, all of that mass, is comprised of Hydrogen. Because of its structure Hydrogen is packed with unimaginable potential for energy which is why you can look up at the night sky (or at the daytime sky for a lesser effect) and see burning balls of Hydrogen dotting the heavens. Once we have sufficient transportation and refining infrastructure in place in space energy costs will become, in theory, trivial. You can mine Helium and Hydrogen from the surface of the moon, launch it into Earth Orbit, and then microwave beam the converted power to Earth-- and once the necessary infrastructure is in place the cost per terawatt/hr plummets.\n\nThose things we consider scarce here on Earth are usually relatively abundant in Space, and the reason we consider them scarce is because the elements and resources we value are generally buried or prohibitively expensive to exploit. In Space that equation is different: heavy loads don't cost as much to move in low/zero G, refining and purification processes are more efficient and produce better results in low/zero G, and the ease *and* abundance of those elements and resources make them so cheap as to be without value. A single asteroid 20mi across pulled from the Belt and placed in orbit around the Earth would provide so many Rare Earth minerals that it would tank the market prices ground-side. Once we reach this level of technological sophistication, with the infrastructure to produce all the refined materials we need in Space, the traditional resource-scarcity model of market economics will become obsolete. How do you attach value to gold when there's nugget of gold orbiting the planet with more gold ready for processing than the Human Race has ever extracted from the Earth across all of time?\n\nSo there's a utopian promise that if we can get the tech, and get that tech into space, we can beat these awful market paradigms we locked ourselves into over the course of the last 3000 years (since the invention of money). That promise is also a veiled threat-- while there's plenty to critique about Human commerce, the present model represents an evolution of behaviors and expectations, in the realm of economic activity, that is a best-fit solution to the Human experience. We broadly respond to stimuli in the same way, we broadly all act in predictable ways when it comes to accumulating stored wealth/resources, negotiating a trade or exchange of goods or services with those resources, and who has access. All of that becomes irrelevant the moment the reality of essentially unlimited resources becomes a reality-- without scarcity Human economic models fall apart.",

Unlimited robotic labor means unlimited food and conservation. This means unlimited leisure time for humans. That's means unlimited time to think, plan, reflect...and...lobby for societal change.\n\nUnlimited power also means unlimited resources as power really mean energy and energy is required for life, just changing forms.\n\nThis translates to no employees, which means loss of societal control, becuase once homes and families are self-sufficient, the no longer will need or be willing to toil for someone else. All these things together are great for humanity but terrible for the rich and those in power because people can keep the fruits of their labor and won't need to work for others but for themselves.\n\nWe won't need utility services like gas or electricity because we can all live \"off grid\".\n\nUnlimited labor means unlimited food because we can garden for ourselves or have robots and ai do thing for us.\n\nCapitalism as a system collapses. Because the only things I'll need to consume are renewable sustainable and self attainable. Unlimited Power = Unlimited clean water. Etc.\n\nAlso means I don't need money as much as we currently do. I don't need money to buy food if my robot is gardening it for me. Which means no sale tax. No utilities fees.\n\nJust look how 2 years of covid scared the bejesus out of the people in power and the societal changes (like work from home), job changes (societal rebalancing/refocusing), advent of ai, decreased consumerism, increased societal connection and reclamation of power (think Isreal boycotts now all over the world), etc. People are waking up to their individual power and autonomy and saying fuck the man.\n\nUnlimited power/energy is the ultimate path to true freedom.\n\nAnd we just can't have that.",

For example, Earth will basically never run out of oil. There is just so fucking much of it inside the Earth. What humanity is running out of is the \"accessible oil that's near the Earth's surface where we can access it\". Accessibility is extremely expensive, until new technologies come out. \n\nAlso, accessibility means you need to be able to store and transfer it.

You can stick a tiny solar panel out in front of your home, and that's effectively unlimited power \\[at least until the sun dies in a few billion years\\], but it doesn't generate many watts. If the watts are too low, it doesn't do a damn thing. If the watts are too high, an individual cannot actually use this. We are actually limited on the amount of volts / amps that can travel along a circuit, especially with metal wiring. Too high of a voltage \\[potential\\], you get arcs. Too low of a voltage, it's useless. Too high of amp \\[current\\], you burn the cable out. Low amps compared with volts are useful, but again we are limited by volts on the low side. A truly unlimited voltage potential = completely unusable, the moment you plug anything into it, it just explodes or the wire burns out immediately due to an arc.",
