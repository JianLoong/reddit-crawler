Years later she contacter me again but I was just starting a different monogamous relationship, it was a bit embarrassing.\n\n\\- Once a girl straigh-up opened asking to snort cocaine from my erect penis. Not even \"hy\", just... that.\n\n\\- I once was knowing someone and quickly realized they were in a very vulnerable position so I decided to keep it as just friends. In retrospect it was a very good call.\n\n\\- I knew someone, then kept talking and decided I wasn't that into her.\n\n\\-  Sometimes I go to gay bars and get understandably hit on by gay men. Flattered but no into it.\n\n\\- I don't know if this one counts but I was once assaulted by a prostitute. She just approached me, grabbed me by the arm with one hand and by my crotch with the other, and tried to seduce me.

Key word: About.\n\nAmong this group was a girl who I considered my friend but she was 17– and you already know where this is going. Some might say that it’s not a big deal because it was consented but I couldn’t do it in good conscience.\n\nThe tricky part, however, was that she had slowly started taking a liking to me and began to physically express it. We talked about life, fitness, work, etc. and it wasn’t long before our group’s first night of hilarity that she got comfortable with me. One playful physical interaction that set the bar— like that one dark joke that lets you know you can make fucked up 9-11 jokes with your new friends.\n\nFrom there, it was continuous engagements with me to hug me, grab me, sit on my lap, and eventually try kissing on me (for fun?). I remember specifically minding my own business and this girl locking me down and trying to kiss my face. Did this all turn something in me on? Yes. I won’t deny it. She was attractive and I will fully confess to wanting to cave so badly.\n\nThe closest I ever got to throwing in the towel was when she sat back on me [at a friends house] in the nightie that belonged to the girl who would be my girlfriend (now-ex). She claimed to not be wearing underwear and between the thoughts in my head and feeling that she wasn’t lying, I was just about ready to split her up the middle buuuut I didn’t.\n\nThings settled after that. I think she just realized it wasn’t going anywhere, kissed my cheek some few nights later and realized I liked the other girl instead. They were besties. Told me to be with her— and I did. Most toxic relationship of my life!\n\nThe end :(",

   "message": "Yes.  My wife and I had a guest staying the night, the kind that snoops and listens to hear if people in the house are having sex - then embarrasses them about it the next day.  \n\nMy wife randomly texts me nudes from the bedroom after everyone went to bed.  She didn't know (at that time) this person had those habits.  I was in the TV room making sure no one \"snooped\" until I could hear their distinctive snoring.  I got the texts from my wife, wanted to take advantage since she doesn't often send naughty pics, but didn't feel like it and declined because we had company (which never stopped us before).  My wife, like most social and attractive women, was not used to being rejected.  She genuinely wanted to make sure I was ok so I had to explain to her in detail why.  She was a little weird out too.",

Half a bottle of wine later and she's suddenly half-naked and jumping on me. After trying to get her off me without hurting her (she was pretty petite) for 10 minutes I tried to storm off. Only to find all the doors locked. I forced my way out through a window and never spoke to her again.",

We ran into each other at a party and she was sloppy drunk and tried to jump me in the bathroom. I said no because I just felt kinda slighted after all that time. She proceeded to follow me up the stairs pulling my pants down and getting aggressive. Finally out of fear of hurting her from shoving her away I just let her do what she felt like doing, which was putting my flaccid dick on her tongue. I laughed watching her try to get me up and she finally just got mad and stormed off. \n\nTLDR it was kinda rapey and I wasn't having it.",
