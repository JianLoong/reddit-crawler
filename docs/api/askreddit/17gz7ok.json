(e.g. Sing for the Moment by Eminem sampling Aerosmith).  \nKid Rock decided to cash in on this trend in the most idiotic way possible and probably had this conversation with his producer:  \n“Yo, I’m gonna make a song that samples Sweet Home Alabama.”  \n“Okay, which parts?”  \n“The beginning, middle, and end.”  \n“So, just the whole thing?”  \n“Yeah.”  \n“What’s the song going to be about?”  \n“It will be about how when I was young I liked listening to the song Sweet Home Alabama.”  \n“So you’re sampling Sweet Home Alabama in a song about liking the song you’re sampling?”  \n“Yeah and I’ll keep calling out the song by name so my audience knows that’s what they’re listening to. And I’m gonna call it… *I Like Sweet Home Alabama.*”  \n“For the love of God please call it something else.”  \n“Deal!

It’s also 100% not my style of music, I much prefer the original over all covers, and I cannot stand it when someone insists that I must listen to an entire 4-5 minute song as they stare me down going “wait for it- wait for it!” and expecting me to have some sort of emotional revelation. \n\nIt’s happened with a handful of songs over my life, but this one was the most far-reaching. It had baby boomers in my family losing their shit, it had young kids in my life going “Hey you should hear this song, it’s really heavy/deep” as if nobody else had ever heard it before Disturbed, and it had people who casually knew I’m a metalhead going “Hey!
