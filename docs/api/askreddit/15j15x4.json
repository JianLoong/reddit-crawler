We had one car and I had just worked a super long day and was tired and just wanted to go home so I was waiting for my ex to come pick me up in our shared vehicle. In stead she pulls up with her mother in her car. I have to sit in the back alone of course and be excluded from conversation and I‚Äôm told we are going to her mothers house to spend the night. I have no clothes to change into and I just want to go home and relax but I‚Äôm told that I‚Äôm being in reasonable and we are going to go watch horror movies(I don‚Äôt like horror movies) and eat food from a restaurant that I hate. They refused to drop me off at home so I got out at a light walked home and moved out. It was a long time coming but that was the final straw after almost 5 years of dealing with this insufferable toxic family.",

   "message": "Because he was a miserable drunk and heroin addict. I‚Äôd put up with him going to jail after 3 DUI‚Äôs, rehab, a car wreck after over dosing on heroin, and his awful family as well. They blamed me for his active addiction, but he‚Äôd been addicted to every substance in existence since before I was even out of HS. His mother is also in love with him and I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs the father of his cousin‚Äôs son. Anyway. The last day we were together before I finally I threw him out, he had sworn he was done with booze and drugs, but snuck vodka into a sprite bottle after getting out of work early. I went to pick him up and he wasn‚Äôt acting drunk yet. We went to Walmart for a late night grocery run, and I remember so vividly watching him go from normal to sloppy. The sloppiest i had ever seen him. The guy had traumatic brain injury so his type of drunk was completely incoherent, unbearable, and such a fucking asshole. He was stumbling all around the aisles, shouting and being just generally embarrassing to be seen with. I knew I‚Äôd reached my breaking point with the relationship because I had spent two years fighting for him to get better and do the right thing and he just refused. I normally would argue, get mad, cry, etc. but that night I was just done. Completely indifferent and silent. After I put the groceries away, while he berated me, kicked the bags I was trying to pickup, screaming incoherent bullshit, threatening to kill the cat I just got just begging for some kind of reaction- I took my kitty and we went to bed with no fight. I had work in the morning. Idk if he just wanted to fight, knew he was losing me and was desperate for a reaction or all of the above, but a few hours later at around 3 am he burst in the door and threw himself on top of me and started kicking the shit out of me. He wasn‚Äôt a very big dude so I got him off of me and went into the living room and he chased after me. He hit me upside the head with something, still don‚Äôt know what, and knocked me to the ground and started choking me. My best friend of ten years luckily lived in the apartment up the stairs which had access to our downstairs apartment and it was unlocked, so I SCREAMED at the top of my lungs for him. He is a six foot two gay man arm muscles the size of my head with a bitch slap from the gods, and my ex was terrified of him- so of course the second my big blonde savior crashed through that door he scrambled off of me and sat down on the chair trying to act like he did nothing wrong. BFF says ‚Äúoh FUCK no, I am tired of you and the way you treat my girl. I‚Äôm calling the fucking cops.‚Äù And ex sees red but still is terrified of BFF, and says ‚Äútry it and I‚Äôll slit your throat‚Äù under his breath and that‚Äôs when I saw red. Because I‚Äôd always been one of those people who just took the bullshit, but one thing I never tolerated was anyone disrespecting my best friend. I lost my shit, ripped off his brand new shoes that I‚Äôd bought him with my full time job, and literally lifted him by the seat of his pants Lorax style and threw him shoeless out into the freezing February rain. Adrenaline gave me my funniest break up story. \n\nIt was Valentine‚Äôs Day. \n\nHe tried several times to get back together with me and I went NC. His new fianc√©e still stalks my social media even though I am happily married with a beautiful daughter. Moral of the story: don‚Äôt waste your time with alcoholics/drug abusers. They are awful partners. Also, don‚Äôt get with a 32 year old when you‚Äôre 20. They don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre mature for their age. Women their age just know better.",
