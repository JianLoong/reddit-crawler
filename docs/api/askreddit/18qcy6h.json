One of which is making cookies and leaving them and some carrots/lettuce out for the reindeer.   \n\nI'm a writer, but in non-fiction (policy and aid). I've written him books and other bits of whimsy, so being asked by him to keep writing is one of the greatest honors and compliments I've ever been given.  \n\nHe's a teen now, and we were up to two or three getting other things done (and baking, of course). Then I had to wait for him to sleep, then sneak out and start wrapping.  \n\nIt's among the hardest because I'm a widower. I'm trying to keep joy in the holiday, so will leave it to your understanding of the myriad reasons this is difficult. \n\nHo ho ho, Santa says Fuck Cancer and to all a good night.",
