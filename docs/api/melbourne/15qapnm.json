 "title": "Why do people shop at supermarkets for fruit and veg?",
 "selftext": "Always shopped around and loved a bargain, but even more now with everything going up so much. Been to a fruit and veg shop in a small shopping centre recently and everything was so much less than the supermarket in the same centre. Went to Preston Market on the weekend and it was even cheaper again. 500g strawberries were $3, cherry tomatoes $1, red capsicum under $3 a kg… etc. Got a big box of fruit and veg for $35. Support the little guys and also save some $$$ people.\n\nEdit: to be clear, we have kids too, and both work full tme. We’re not 20 year old and have a lazy weekend day to do what we like. With all of the complaining about supermarket prices I’m asking why people shop there… If it’s just convenience then you pay for that.",
