   "message": "I was going to say the entirety of Led Zep 4 but it was like a couple of years later and as good as that album was, by 1969 Led Zeppelin were around so it would be just like hearing the new shit from a band that time.\n\nSo 3 songs I’d do: \n\nNo One Knows - Queens of the Stone Age (not my fave but everyone loves this song)\n\nCloser - Nine Inch Nails (it would blow people’s minds)\n\nChop Suey - System of a Down (such a unique sound, no one would ever expect it.)\n\nI love all these songs but they’re not my favourites, I’m just thinking of what would have the most impact from the things I love. \n\nOthers which would be cool would be Ball and Biscuit by White Stripes\n\nShout by Tears for Fears\n\nWhere is my Mind by Pixies or like any of their old shit really, it is so fucking unique. \n\nAnything from Tool.",
