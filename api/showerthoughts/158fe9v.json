Yeah I like those.

After she passed my wife my grandaughter turned to her and said in a loud voice ‚ÄúGrammy wasn‚Äôt she just beautiful?‚Äù. The grin on this woman as she passed me was just priceless.",

After the show, everyone was shuffling out, and I was going against the flow to get my coat.\n\nAs I worked my way upstream, I saw a fairly buzzed guy hitting on a woman. She was smiling and appeared to be into it (and also buzzed). I ended up standing next to them for a few seconds. The guy looked me up and down, smiled, and said, \"Hey, you gotta keep going. You're too good-looking, give the rest of us a chance.\" We all laughed, and I kept going.\n\nThat one comment from a stranger has probably made more of an impact on my aesthetic self-image than anything my friends/partners have said because 1) his only knowledge of me was how I looked in that moment and 2) he had no incentive to artificially bolster my confidence/endear himself to me.",
