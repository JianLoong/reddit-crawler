   "message": "The best one I ever saw in person was when myself and my best friend (Tom) watched our other friend (Pat) pour gasoline onto an already-burning campfire. The moment we saw him reaching for the jerry can, Tom and I both looked at one another wordlessly before both taking a massive step back in unison.\n\nThe flames predictably *climbed* the stream of fuel to the nozzle of the jerry can Pat was holding in his hand, lighting the tip of said nozzle on fire. Pat turned the nozzle toward him and inspected the flaming nozzle as if perplexed by this development, never setting the beer in his free hand down at any point. He decides the best course of action is to bring the nozzle closer to his face and *blow the fire out as if he was blowing out a candle*.\n\nSomehow it worked and he survived before glancing over at the two of us without a care in the world. Tom was silent for a long moment, simply staring at him with his arms crossed before finally breaking the awkward silence with this gem: **\"You know, it never ceases to amaze me that natural selection hasn't claimed you yet.\"**",
