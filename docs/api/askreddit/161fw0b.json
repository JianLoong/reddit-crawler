Our well-worn VHS of \"Star Trek: the Voyage Home\" was probably my most watched film as a child. Growing up I discovered the joy of simply hearing the man's voice, and later found out he did a few audiobooks. Later still, when I was going through a phase of reading celebrity autobiographies I found his (\"I Am Not Spock,\" and the follow-up: \"I Am Spock\") to be extremely insightful. His passion for both the dream of Star Trek itself, and the craft of acting in general were limitless. I was absolutely overjoyed to see him featured in a key role in \"Fringe,\" and when news of his passing came in 2015, I was literally in tears for a week.  \n\n\nAs an adult who received a later Autism diagnosis a lot of what I saw in Mr. Spock, and subsequently Nimoy himself made a lot more sense. See, I seldom if EVER \"identify\" with a fictional character, but Spock - to me at least was always more human than human.",
