I've told this story before, I grew up in the Great Lakes area when I was a kid and when I was about 10 I fell in an ice fishing hole (Lake Superior is  a damn cold lake).  That traumatized me for life against the cold and as soon as I graduated high school I immediately moved to Florida.  Say what you want but I like it here, I actually get cold here too but it's a far cry better than the alternative.\n\nA perfect day to me (I'm not crazy, don't hold living in Florida against me) is 95F with at least that percentage humidity.  I never run the AC in my car and my house AC broke but I don't care and won't get it fixed.  I'll leave the doors and windows open all summer long.\n\nFalling in that ice fishing hole changed my body's thermostat and I can't stand anything below 75F",
