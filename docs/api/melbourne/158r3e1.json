 "title": "Dog attack outside school this morning",
 "selftext": "I‚Äôve posted for advice in the past regarding an owner who leaves her dog unattended at the school during drop offs. The dog has always been calm and seems friendly but I‚Äôve raised concerns with both the owner and the school because dogs, and kids, can both be unpredictable. Each time the owner would become aggressive with me and talks about how controlled and kind their dog is and that it would never hurt anyone. The school hasn‚Äôt really taken anything but token action.  \n\nWell this morning the dog attacked another dog out of nowhere. It was with the owner but she couldn‚Äôt control it, it pulled the leash out of her hands, ran across the street and mauled a much smaller dog. \n\nThat could have been a child. \n\nSo to anyone out there who thinks they know their dog, or anyone who is kinda nervous. Report that shit. If the school and the owner don‚Äôt take it seriously, call 000.",

   "message": "I work in a vet clinic in Melbourne.. last week a very distressed elderly owner walked in with her small dog who had just been attacked by another dog on a nearby street.\n\n The owner explained she attempted to save her dog that was being literally tossed around and was bitten on her hand in the process. She had puncture wounds and bruising on her hands. Miraculously her dog was not seriously injured. \n\nApparently the attacking dogs owner came out from her house (attack was on the street) and called her dog back in to their property. She was completely unapologetic and refused to help! \n\nLuckily the owner had witnesses to back her up. She reported to council and police, however police said nothing they can do and it is a council matter only.\n\nI realise they can't get involved in every dog attack,  but I was surprised that a human being bitten by a loose dog doesn't rank as a police matter... I wonder at what point they step in? \n\nDoes it need to be to a level requiring hospitalisation? or fatality???  \n\nWhat happens if dog in OPs post actually bites a child?  \n\nIt doesn't seem right...\n\n\nTLDR - elderly lady was bit by a loose dog and police refused to get involved.",
