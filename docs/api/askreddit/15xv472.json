   "message": "Sorry for the spelling\n\n\n\n\nAs someone who live in Europe so this doesent affect me i really dont have some huge problem with this. But Trump was actually good as a president. People were afraid to attack their soldners and bases. And as much people hate him and he definitly fid some dirty stuff like 99.9% he is smart as a leader and investor. \n\n\n\n\nNow did he do some things that will take him to prison, we will see. I really dont know because i dont know the whole picture. All i know that he was good president. And i know that people were against the wall thing. But i live in Europe and trust me, the wall could be the best thing because we in almost every country in Europe have soo many crazy shit with the refugees. They steal, beat the people, do violent acts, they even tried to rape some teen girl close to my town. And now when Europe take them in its almost impossible to control it because there are millions of them and comming. And Trump tried to stop it. Look i dont hate anyone but i know what is happening in Mexico and its not nice. There are many YouTube channals about it. \n\n\n\n\n\nAgain iam not on any side, but if Trump did something that deserve prison he deserve to serve it no matter who he is or who he was. I dont live there soo this doesent affect me one bit. But we all know that rich always find a way out. But if he didnt do it than leave him be. But the main reason why he need to deal with this right now is because he want to candidate one more time and everyone knows that they cant control him and big guys dont like it. This is the main reason. I mean its really strange how they are doing this right now when biden time is gone. And they can control biden because he cant talk by himself, but Trump is the whole another thing. Soo trust me on this. They really dont care about what Trump did. They want to put him somwhere soo he cant be the president because they cant control him soo they want to lock him up.",
