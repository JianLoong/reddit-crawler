 "selftext": "Hi y’all, I’m sorry for posting here. I genuinely need you guys’ opinion and will accept whatever verdict you give me. \n\nI’m pregnant. I decided I was going to give the baby up for adoption quite soon after finding out, due to many reasons (among them my age and stuff). \n\nMy family knows. The father doesn’t though, and I don’t want to tell him. He wasn’t a kind person when we were dating. (I don’t wanna get into it too much.) We were sort of together and it went bad FAST. I ended up blocking him and cutting off contact, which was a struggle in itself. \n\nI feel like if I tell him, he’ll use it in a way to keep me close. But maybe I’m being too selfish…? I don’t know. I figured if I told everyone that I didn’t know who the father is, I’d be able to do it without his permission. Maybe? But idk. \n\nSorry for this. \n\nAITA for not telling him?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for replying. I’m really grateful, even if I’m the AH. Can I just ask not to send chats? \n\nAlso, I do know I need to stay away from him myself. But I don’t know if he’s like this with others, or maybe he’d be a good father. That’s why I feel conflicted. Just because I brought that out in him, doesn’t mean others will, I guess. He’s not a horrible person. ",
