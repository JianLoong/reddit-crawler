That song started getting a ton of radio play when I was a teenager and having to come to terms with the fact that I was not like everyone else and would not be able to have some of the things one is taught to want in life.  It was the start of a very dark time, I was depressed for years, etc, and that song kind of became emblematic of that pain.  I'm in my 50s now and even though I have long since come to terms with myself and my life I still can't listen to that song without bawling my eyes out because it reminds me so strongly of the bad times.",
