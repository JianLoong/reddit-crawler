They know I do it, but they'd all flip their shit if they knew that my collection was going to pass the $10,000 mark in a few months.\n\nI don't know why anyone thinks it's their business since it's my own money, I can afford it, and it isn't hurting anything, but I know they'd all say stuff like \"you could have spent that on a vacation or something else more meaningful\" if they knew and dealing with that is a hard pass. No point getting into an argument with a bunch of people that don't understand how to just let others enjoy things.",
