They're culturally X religion, but they do not read the texts, they do not devote themselves to following the practices, or following the tenets. They wear the symbols, identify as being that religion - but they aren't actually practicing their faith. \n\nI believe the Archbishop of Canterbury said, \"Being born in a garage doesn't make you a car.\" In other words, go to a church doesn't make you a Christian. \n\nMost religions have fairly good tenets that if practiced earnestly would be largely beneficial. Even though they may have some stupid ideas, much of it is offset by other ideas and requirements of the faith. \n\nIt's the culturally religious folks that end up being extremists or cherry picking their beliefs to let them abuse others, etc.",

It's very effective for controlling the masses for better or for worse.\n\nSometimes the results are good (like people not killing each other because it's against their religion), but sometimes the results are bad (like hindering science because it's against their religion). I naively believed that if you removed religion, people would gain the ability to finally think rationally and logically instead of worshiping dogma spread by others.\n\nUnfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of worshiping God, they instead worship identity politics and radical political agendas. They substituted the church of Christianity for the church of woke, which in practice, is a hell of a lot more harmful than modern Christianity and so far, without any of the regulatory safeguards like separation of church and state.\n\nSimilarly, in communist countries that banned religion, they replaced worshiping God with worshiping the State and/or its leader.\n\nHistory has now shown that the masses will never be able to rationally and logically think for themselves. They're always looking to worship someone else's' ideas.",

To quote my Tibetan Buddhist teacher, a classically trained Lama: Buddha and these beings are archetypes, not gods.

I genuinely apologize to anyone that disagrees with my sentiments or takes offence as I don't hate religion but genuinely struggle to understand it.\n\nI personally find many of the Metaphysical claims to be implausible, the historiographical claims to be dubious evidence of the religion's supernatural claims, and the ethics to be questionable and not requiring the appeal to a higher order. I typically see religion as the means of condoning hegemonic systems that reflective societal values more than they reflect the teachings of the original myths which reflected the values of a different society and time.\n\nI am not naive enough to think I know more or less about ontology, the world, or the universe than any person of faith -- but I am a little insulted when I am not granted the same benefit of the doubt. Personally I would love to find faith and am touched by those that try and share their beliefs with me. Unlike many atheists I am always touched by those that will keep me in their prayers, or share their religious blessings. But I simply cannot believe in any of the faiths I have explored, as they have yet to provide me with any meaningful answers or even any sense of internal peace.\n\nBaruch Spinoza helped me clarify some of my own relationship to faith in that I agree with many key points but do not understand the reasoning behind personifying the Universe as 'God'. I understand the personal and spiritual desire to do so but as someone raised in a secularist household it feels like a bizarre and counter intuitive move when you can just accept it for what it is... nature.
