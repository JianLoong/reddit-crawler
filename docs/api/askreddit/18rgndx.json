I had a headache for 4 days when I got COVID, after a few vaccinations.\n\nShe also has anxiety attacks and fainting spells that she believes are ghosts and spirits surrounding her and warning her about something bad about to happen. She won't see any doctors or counselors for these issues because she believes that medicine and therapy/counseling are fake.\n\nShe is a nurse in the Mayo systems hospital.\n\nI'm sorry that this isn't exactly answering the question, but as soon as she started talking about vaccinations I knew that I was done with her.",
