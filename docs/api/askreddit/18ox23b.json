They literally cannot ejaculate in proximity to a woman who intends to place their sperm in her vagina. *I am not saying this fact is any kind of moral wrong, just saying that it strikes me as bizarrely extreme.* Men literally cannot deny consent to parenthood except by turning down sex. Outside of the many sound reasons behind these laws, doesn’t that seem a tad…excessive?",
