 "title": "AITAH for punishing my son 'too much' for making sexist comments on the internet?",
 "selftext": "I have two children, a 17-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. Recently, my daughter showed me some comments that my son was making on some online posts with his friends. He was mocking female soccer players, saying they didn't know how to play and that they should go back to the kitchen. In other posts, he made comments about how women only care about money and are only useful for household chores. I was saddened and irritated by his behavior; I've always tried to educate him to respect women.\n\nI confronted my son, and he said it was just a joke, that he wasn't serious and that it was how his friends joked. He said I was overreacting and that I didn't understand the jokes. I didn't accept these excuses; I had a long conversation with him and decided to punish him. I took away his computer, canceled the subscriptions to the online games he plays, and prohibited him from playing anything for a month. I also made him cut off contact with those online 'friends' of his. He tried to protest, but I stood firm.\n\nMy husband agrees that our son was wrong but thinks I was too harsh on him. He says I should have given him a chance to redeem himself, that he's just a teenager, that he will grow and change. He says I should let him play at least on weekends, that he needs a hobby, that he doesn't have many friends.\n\nI don't think I'm overreacting; I believe he needs to understand that his actions have consequences. AITA?",
