 "selftext": "[Original prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/154v8n1/wp_youre_a_superhero_you_would_consider_yourself/)\n\n*Mausam*\n\r\nMemory is such a fickle thing. One day you want to remember every colourful detail of your life and the other day you want nothing more than to never remember a thing again. But what happens when one of those wishes is granted? \n\r\nI don’t know because I don’t remember. \n\r\n*\n\r\nCaptain Great had once again called me to the battle against The Castigator. The Castigator had turned into one of the biggest villains the world had ever seen and recently he had joined the group of villains, they called themselves The Saviours. Unfortunately, the only thing they saved was themselves. \n\r\nI look at the destruction that was around me. I see Justice flying high to deliver a well-placed kick to Castigator’s stomach but he barely flinched. \n\r\nIn all honesty, I don’t know what I’m doing here. If Justice and Captain Great together can’t defeat him then there’s no chance that I could. My powers are basic at best. There’s a reason why I was never welcomed in any hero groups. \n\r\nBut I still try. I use my power to change the weather just above Castigator’s head (I can only change weather over a minute area). The lighting does surprise him for he looks my way. \n\r\nAnd then nothing. \n\r\nMy memory draws a blank as I try to think of something that must have happened. But I cannot. I find out that Captain and Justice together defeated the Castigator. There’s no mention of me. Because I honestly did nothing except surprise him. \n\r\nBut then why can’t I remember?\n\r\n*\n\r\nThe next time the League of Heroes calls me it’s because Grovan the Ruiner had attacked the city. His powers outstrip the powers of all the heroes combined. So, it’s still a mystery as to why I’m here. I’m not complaining. I’m happy to serve my city and help the citizens. But, this is the word that hangs in my consciousness after every summon. But why? But how? I can’t let it bother me. \n\r\nAnd yet, bothered I am. \n\r\nI try to change the weather over Thunder so that she can harness the power and then once again I find the darkness surrounding me. I try to fight it. But I start to succumb. \n\r\nHelplessly, I let go of the hope to stay conscious. \n\r\nI try to ask everyone what happened. They all reply that we won, albeit a little coldly, it was expected. I was a no-good hero who kept passing out mid-battle and yet they kept calling me back. \n\r\nBut why?\n\r\n*\n\r\nI have never been to the League of Heroes headquarters. Why would I? I wasn’t a part of it. I was only called for major catastrophes. Yet, it was a surprise when I was called.\n\r\nI walk in, drinking in the surroundings greedily. This may be my first and last time here. I see the polished walls, made from unbendable metal from Brakus (Jrast’s home planet). \n\r\n“There you are. Come on.” Warrior Boy calls me. I doubt he even knows my name. I doubt anyone except Captain and Justice did. \n\r\nI follow not wanting to get scolded by someone for loitering. I pass the conference room where a familiar face is on the screen, I don’t know who but something inside me stirs. \n\r\n“Weather!” Cyrano yells in recognition. \n\r\n“That’s not my name,” I mumble but I don’t think he heard me or even cares about it. \n\r\n“Mausam! Welcome.” Captain welcomes me with a tired smile. It’s obvious that he has been working for a long time and yet it warms my heart that he is here. \n\r\n“Captain.” I nod. “How can I help you?” \n\r\n“You know about The Saviours?” Captain enquires. \n\r\nI nod again. \n\r\n“We just captured Sicario, their leader.”\n\r\n“That’s amazing, Captain,” I say heartily. It was a big win for the heroes. \n\r\nCaptain flashes me a smile. “Thank you. We would like you to question him.”\n\r\nI stare at Captain. Obviously, I misheard.\n\nThere’s no way that out of all these heroes I was selected for interrogation. \n\r\n“He’s in Cell 5. We’ll be nearby and the room is monitored so you’ll be safe. If he tries something we’ll subdue him before he can lift his hand.” Captain assures me.\n\r\nBut this is not about assuring. Before I could say something I find myself guided towards the Cell. \n\r\n*\n\r\n“It is you.” Sicario breathes as soon as I enter. \n\r\nAll the air escapes from my lungs as I see his face. It is the same familiar face I saw on the screen of the conference room. But to see him face to face is like running towards a tornado. \n\r\n“I know you,” I whisper. “Why do I know you?” \n\r\n“Because- “ \n\r\nSome kind of electric shock must be built into the handcuffs he was wearing because he jolts, his eyes rolling back. I scream stop over and over again. Seeing him in pain breaks something in me. There’s a sudden flash of memory of him standing by my side. We are watching the sunset together. \n\r\nFinally, it stops. I find my voice is hoarse from screaming. He looks tired- so tired that I want to comfort him. Tell him to go to sleep. \n\r\nI frown. This is the biggest supervillain out there. Why am I reacting like this? Sure, he was handsome in a deadly way but that doesn’t make it right. \n\r\n“Tell me what you know,” I ask coolly. If I feign calmness then maybe this feeling would go away. \n\r\n“I know you.” He says softly before another violent shudder overtakes him. \n\r\n“Stop!” I scream and this time it does. \n\r\nBefore I could help it another memory flashes through my mind. \n\r\n*Sicario is kissing my hand. I look at him, happiness radiating off me.*\n\r\nMy heart is beating wildly in my chest. I know him. Or I knew him. I just can’t remember. I open my mouth to ask another question when my brain reminds me that, it is possible, he would be punished again. \n\r\nI leave without saying another word. Captain tries to talk to me but I fake a headache and leave. \n\r\nFor it is not my head that hurts but my heart remembering Sicario’s face twisted in agony. \n\r\n*\n\r\nThat night hazy memories assault me. I dream. I dream of heroes and villains. I dream of Sicario. I dream of Sicario with me. It isn’t until the last dream that I jerk awake.  \n\r\nA beach. A ring. Two people in love. \n\r\nHusband. He was my husband.\n\r\n*\r\n*Sicario*\n\r\nI stare at the space where she had stood. My allies had told me that she was alive. That she was working with the heroes but I didn’t believe them. How could I? I watched her die. Felt my soul break in two. \n\r\n“I told you not to tell her.” Captain’s voice was grating on my senses. Hatred flowed through my veins at the sight of him. \n\r\n“You did this.” I spat. There is no accusation in my tone because I was not accusing. I knew that these bastards were responsible for Mausam’s state. \n\r\nHer suffering. \n\r\n“No. You did that.” Captain sneered. \n\r\nIt took all the training I possessed not to throw myself against the unyielding walls of my cage. I wanted to wrap my hands around the bastard’s neck till he could feel the pain he made Mausam go through, till he felt the pain I went through. \n\r\n“You can pay for your crimes or Mausam will. It’s your choice.” Captain said. \n\r\nThe bastard knew I would never let anything happen to Mausam. I never feared death, I had been dead ever since I saw her dying on that wretched day. But after seeing her again, a spark of life flared inside me. \n\r\nCaptain turned to leave. I watch him, my hatred growing with every step he took. \n\r\n“I am going to kill you,” I promise. \r\nCaptain looked over his shoulder, his overconfidence spilled over his being. \n\r\n“You can’t,” Captain replied. “You love her too much.”\n\r\n*\r\n*Mausam*\n\r\nMy hands are shaking. The dreams- the memories- hadn’t let go of her. I look at the pictures on the table beside my bed. A thought, that had always plagued me but I never gave into it, reared its head again. I did not remember when this picture was taken or where.\n\r\nWhy can’t I remember? \n\r\nWere my dreams just dreams or memories? I don’t know. \n\r\nSicario’s face swirled in front of my eyes. The emptiness I had felt day in and day out suddenly felt like a chasm. His face called something in me- a memory out of reach, a life lost. \n\r\nBut that can’t be right. I had never met the man. I had only heard about him. I even saw his face for the first time at the Headquarters! Then why does it feel like I have known him for a lifetime? \n\r\nLike some part of me belonged to him. \n\r\nLike some part of him belonged to me. \n\r\nThis was madness. Flashes of memories started to appear in my mind so dizzyingly fast that I couldn’t see even a single one clearly. \n\r\nI hold my head in my hands. This was too overwhelming. My mind refuses to quiet down. It played the memories on a loop, the ones I couldn’t see, and repeated one word over and over again. \n\r\n*Husband. Husband. Husband.*\n\r\nThe noises were getting too loud. Everything around me looked fake. I felt fake. \n\r\n*Husband. Husband. Husband.*\n\r\nI cover my ears to quieten them. But it wasn’t working. The voices and the memories were getting louder. I couldn’t take it anymore. \n\r\nI screamed. \n\r\nThe world started to darken. I think I heard a distant thunder and someone calling my name before I pass out. \n\r\n*\r\n*Sicario*\n\r\nI hear the thunder roiling and I know it’s her. I call out her name, desperation that I always tried to keep in check bleeding through the edges. \n\r\nShe was hurting.\n\r\nI needed to escape, needed to get to Mausam. Without thinking what I was doing, I punched the glass cage I was in. The static field that covered the walls threw me back. \n\r\nI feel the consciousness slipping through my fingers. \n\r\nI had to hold on. \n\r\nMausam needed me.  \n\r\n*\r\n*Mausam*\n\r\nThe questions were getting louder day by day. I didn’t know how long I could hold them anymore. \n\r\nAnyone’s first reaction in a situation like this would be to talk to their family or friends. I can’t think of either. I don’t remember if I have any family; every time I think about the word family Sicario’s face comes to my mind. I don’t have friends apart from the League of Heroes and even I’m not that delusional to consider them friends. \n\r\nIt’s as if anything besides the past 2 years of my life has been erased. \n\r\nAnd that thought is terrifying. I know something sinister must have happened, if I was a powerful hero then I would have said that it was the work of anyone from The Saviours. \n\r\nBut why would a league of villains want to erase the memory of a no-good hero like me?\n\r\n*\n\r\nDr Fawkes was the highest recommended therapist by Google. I stand nervously outside the building where his office was situated, reconsidering my decision. \n\r\nDo I really need a therapist? It’s just my memories. The League of Heroes could help me. \n\r\n*No!*\n\r\nIt was such a visceral reaction that I blinked a few times. Why does my subconscious didn’t trust the League of Heroes? They did good work. They were good. Then why was it that seeds of doubt were planted? I have always trusted them, fought by their side then why? Did it start when I met Sicario? When I noticed how the heroes treated him when he tried to tell me something. \n\r\nSomething inside me twisted painfully every time his face flashed in my mind.\r\nMy head started pounding in my skull. I notice the clouds darkening the sky, it was going to rain soon, and just like that, my choice was made. \n\r\nSteeling my spine, I walk into the building. \n\r\n*\n\r\n“Dr Fawkes will see you now.” The receptionist, Amber, tells me. \n\r\nI smile weakly. My heart was pounding and a sudden chill had overtaken me. I dreaded opening this door. \n\r\nWhy? What was I so scared of finding out?\n\r\nGathering my courage before it left me, I push open the door and freeze. \n\r\nSitting in the therapist chair is Captain.  \n\r\n*\r\n*Sicario.*\n\r\n“I know you are not their leader.” A voice distracts me from my thoughts.\n\r\nI try to search my memory, and it doesn’t take me long to identify him. Cyrano. A new addition to the League of Heroes. He was known for his cunning mind. His battle plans were flawless. \n\r\nIt was a pity that this man worked for the League. \n\r\n“I have been researching about The Saviours ever since they came into existence. You know what I found?” He asks moving closer to my glass cage. \n\r\nI say nothing. I study him. He looked like a harmless guy but then that’s what the League thought about him too. \n\r\n“They came into existence 3 years ago. A year before Mausam joined the league.” He continues. \n\r\nI grit my teeth. The fury of hearing Mausam’s name from anyone in this league was blinding. \n\r\n“Calm down.” I look at him annoyed and he smiles. “I can sense moods too.\"\n\r\n“What do you want?” I say through clenched teeth. \n\r\n“Nothing. I just want to tell you a story.” He says innocently. \n\r\n“Fuck off.” \n\r\n“I will. But first, story. Three years ago, Earth was attacked by an army from the future. There were, obviously, multiple casualties. One of them was Mausam. How am I doing so far?” \n\r\nI say nothing. \n\r\nScreams fill my ears, the vision of streets that ran red with blood freezing me. I am trying to hold on to the one person who meant everything to me. \n\r\n“What do you want?” I ask again. \n\r\nHe ignores me. “Only two citizens were taken by them. This is not in any official report, just in case you were wondering. In fact, officially, Mausam and Sicario never existed.” \n\r\nI close my eyes against the images. \n\r\n*Mausam was being held by two of them. I scream to get to her but they inject me with something. The last thing I see is Captain Great entering the room.*\n\r\n“Then two days later Mausam was declared dead.” \n\r\n“Shut up,” I say, the visions of those people plunging their knife through her heart takes over my senses. \n\r\n“The man that was taken with her disappears. He is seen a year later with one of the biggest villains leading the attack with Grovan. This man, who had never shown any powers had somehow gained abilities.”\n\r\n“Shut up.” The static is running through my body I could feel the energy on my fingertips. \n\r\n“A new group of Villains is formed. They were undefeated. No hero could defeat them alone. Even Captain and Justice. Then one day something changes. A woman with minor powers is seen, unconsciously, helping the League and the villain just stopped.” \n\r\n“SHUT UP!” Power erupts through me like thousand lightning bolts. The chamber creaks at the energy it tries to contain but doesn’t break. The handcuffs, on the other hand, do. \n\r\nCyrano doesn’t look perturbed. “I thought why would Grovan be defeated so easily? He is a powerful man. But one look at this woman and he doesn’t lift a single finger. He lets himself be defeated. Why?”\n\r\nGrovan sent a message to me that day from prison. He told me he had seen Mausam. He said that she was alive. I didn’t believe him. How could I? I watched her being murdered. I saw the knife pierce her skin. Saw her take her last breath. \n\r\n“Mausam was made a pseudo-member of this team, only called when The Saviours attacked. And the battle that was always in their favour turned to ours. We always won.” \n\r\nHis heart was beating too fast. He knew everything and yet something inside him told him to stop listening. \n\r\n“Then a few days ago their so-called leader gets himself captured and I think why? Why would he do that?” He was even closer to the glass now. \n\r\n“Then I see Mausam screaming stop over and over again when Justice ordered those shocks, that would have killed any human or even superhuman.” \n\r\n“Why are you telling me this?” I ask finally. \n\r\nHe gave me a small smile. “Don’t you get it? I found out the truth.”\n\r\n*\n\r\n*Mausam*\n\r\nI stare at the Captain. He smiles at me and for the first time, his smile sends chills down my spine. \n\r\n“Oh, don’t worry, Mausam,” Captain says coolly. “I’m here to help you.”\n\r\n“Where is Dr Fawkes?” I ask. I try to look calm and collected but there’s a storm raging inside me. \n\r\n“I’m Dr Fawkes.” He laughed. “Do you really think my real name is Captain Great?”\n\r\nI force myself to laugh. There’s a glint in his eyes that scares the shit out of me. \n\r\n“So, how can I help you?” He asks as he points me to the chair in front of him.\n\r\n“I-uh,” I obviously can’t tell him the truth so I choose the closest lie instead. “I am having trouble sleeping.”\n\r\n“And when did this problem start?” He asks.\n\r\nTwo years ago. “Like for a couple of weeks.”\n\r\nHe hums then makes a note. “Is it because you’ve been falling unconscious often?”\n\r\n“I don’t know.” \n\r\nHe tilts his head and then flashes me an apologetic smile. “I hear something. I’ll be back shortly. Amber will be with you till then.”\n\r\nI try to say that it’s okay but he leaves before I could. \n\r\nAmber enters the room. And for some reason, she looks at me with pity.\n\r\n“I am so happy you are here.” She says after a moment.\n\r\nI look at her confused. \n\r\n“I know you don’t remember me but I was there. It’s never easy. My sister went through the same thing- “\n\r\nI interrupt her because it doesn’t make any sense. “I’m sorry but what are you talking about?” \n\r\nShe looks at me sympathetically. “Losing a baby.”\n\r\n*\n\r\n*Sicario*\n\r\n“A prophecy?” I blinked.\n\r\n“More like the future because, you know, the army was from the future,” Cyrano says.\n\r\nI continue to stare at him. Nothing makes sense anymore. \n\r\n“It was about a child born with powers so immense that he would turn this world to dust.”\n\r\n“I still don’t- “\n\r\n“It was your child! Your and Mausam’s! She was pregnant when she was taken.” Cyrano cries. \n\r\nA child. Our child. Mausam was-\n\r\n“I know- actually, I don’t know- but we really need to get out of here. I only waited so you don’t kill me immediately. Captain would be here soon.”\n\r\n“Let him come!” Rage fills me. Every bit of me is filled with so much sorrow and hate that I can’t think of anything except making Captain pay. \n\r\n“No. You need to find Mausam. She doesn’t know how powerful she is. Captain put a wall in her mind, it’s starting to break.” Cyrano says as he starts to enter the pin.\n\r\nMausam. She doesn’t even know. Pain spears me once again.\n\r\nBlood spatters on the glass. I look up and see Cyrano or what was left of him lying on the floor. Blood pooled around him. Captain stood in front of me now. His hands were stained red with Cyrano's blood.\n\r\n“He was always a nosy bastard.”\n\r\n*\n\r\n*Mausam*\n\r\nMemories after memories start to tumble out. \n\r\n*Sicario and me, our life together. Us running from those men that attacked our city. Sicario passing out after that man injected him with something. Captain entering the room, telling me I was too important to die. He injected me with something. Darkness then a bright light. The immense pain I felt as someone tries to soothe me, her hands gentle. Another injection then nothing. I remember waking up not knowing anything except that my name was Mausam. I was surrounded by strangers. A man introducing himself as Captain Great. He told me that I was found beneath a building. The feeling of being grateful. I see a fight break out between Captain Great, a woman in armour and another man. I feel the power flowing through my veins, and a tiny thundercloud appeared above the man attacking Captain.*\n\r\nAll the lies they told me. All the lies *he* told me. I feel anger channel itself into my veins. Lightning strikes the window of the Captain’s office. Amber’s scream reminds me that I’m not alone.\n\r\n*The one with gentle hands.*\n\r\n“I need to go,” I say curling my hands into fists. “Tell the captain- I’ll tell him myself.”\n\r\n*\n\r\n*Sicario*\n\r\n“Not that I need to explain myself but I only did it to save the world,” Captain says nonchalantly. \n\r\n“You bastard!” I scream as electricity bursts through me. A tiny crack appears in the glass making me smile coldly.\n\r\n“I should have killed you that day,” Captain says not noticing the cracked glass. “What can I say? I’m one of those sentimental heroes.” \n\r\nThunder rumbles and there’s a crack of lightning. “I’m going to kill you.”\n\r\n“You can’t.” He shrugs. “Mausam will never forgive you.” \n\r\n“Won’t I?” Mausam says as she enters the room. \n\r\nShe is aglow with fury. The League follows behind her, not attacking her but with her. \n\r\n“You lied.” Spits Justice. “You told us she was working with them.”\n\r\n“And she is. She’s here to free him!” Captain says desperately. \n\r\n“What about Cyrano?” Warrior says spitefully.\r\n“He was helping him!” \n\r\n“Lies!” Justice exclaims. “Cyrano left everything he found because he knew, he knew what you would do.”\n\r\nJust like that, his mask dropped. Captain’s face contorted in fury as he made his way towards me. Another burst of electricity has the glass shattering. I want nothing more than to make this bastard pay for everything he has done. Sudden lightning blinds me, before I can move, I hear the thud of a body falling.\n\r\n“You will never hurt us again,” Mausam says coldly as she stares at Captain, who lies on the ground. His body was severely burnt. \n\r\nHe snarls as he tries to get up but this time, I shoot him with a bolt of raw power. He groans but doesn’t try to get up this time. I am ready to finish him off when a soft hand stops me. \n\r\n“No.” She says softly. “He doesn’t deserve the mercy of death.” \n\r\n“But-“\n\r\nI start but she shakes her head. “We have already lost so much because of him. We can’t lose our souls too.”\n\r\nI stare at her. Feeling I would never get enough of her eyes on me, of her hands against mine. \n\r\n“He’s their problem now.” She nods at the League but I don’t look away. \n\r\nShe takes my hand, interlinking our fingers. \n\r\n“Let’s go home.”\n\n*The end.*\n\n**\nYou can find more of my stories at r/iknowthisischeesy",
