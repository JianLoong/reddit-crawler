After his initial incarceration he didn’t know how to function as a free citizen so he keeps getting himself sent back to jail. For example, he got out of jail around a year ago and couldn’t make his first months rent. His solution was to walk to the convenience store, steal a beer, and sit on the curb waiting for the cops to arrive.",
