Figured I'd be safe, and get a dish with \"ris.\"  I figured \"well, it has rice.  Can't be all bad.\"\n\nExcept the French word for \"rice\" is \"riz.\"  \n\n\"Ris\" is French for \"sweetbreads.\"  Almost tossed my cookies.",

I was bored to tears and kept hopefully eyeing the beautiful snacks set up on silver trays. Finally!  It was eating time. I headed straight for what I thought was cream filled chocolates, sat down and popped a whole one in my mouth. My sister watched in horror as my face turned green, but I somehow managed to swallow it. I was afraid to eat anything else after that.",
