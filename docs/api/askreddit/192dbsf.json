   "message": "Bats. Super fascinating creatures that many people fear, and most don't well understand.\n\nThere are approximately 1400 species (20% of mammals) of bats around the world, split into two major groups: mega and microchirpotera. Most are insectivorous, with many of the rest eating fruit or nectar. Some fewer eat fish (seriously, they can detect a fin breaking the top of the water and will scoop the fish up in a fly-by), mice, lizards. Only three species partake of blood, and two of those prefer avian blood.\n\nOne of my local species, the Mexican Free-Tailed Bat, has the current record for fastest horizontal movement of any animal, reaching 99 miles per hour. Not happy with just that, it also migrates at 10,000' from places such as California and Kansas down to Baja California or Northeastern Mexico.\n\nMicrochiroptera, the smaller bats are amazing fliers. While flitting about, they can easily navigate around hair-thin strings without touching them, and can turn a 180 within their own body length.\n\nIn agriculture, many vineyards use bat boxes, encouraging insectivorous bats to inhabit the area, employing our little wingy friends as a natural pest control. Additionally, their guano (poop) is often used as a fertilizer or soil amendment as its rich in nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.\n\nThey're really fascinating creatures who are so important for our environment, but have long gotten a bad rap in Western cultures. (China and some Eastern cultures consider them to be lucky.)",

   "message": "Probably the Blobfish as they are seen as ugly and all (they were voted the world's ugliest animal) but in reality the blobfish just sorta looks like a normal fish when at its natural environment since it is a deep sea creature thousands of feet below the ocean. The anatomy for the blobfish is designed for the deep sea environment where the pressure is high. When the blobfish get brought to the surface, the blobfish suffers severe decompression damage which ends up making them look like the blobfish we all know of. Blobfish rely on the water pressure to hold their shape together because they don't have any strong bones or thick muscle in them. \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also don't have any known natural predators. However, they may be threatened by destructive human activities.",
