I remember growing up as a kid who loved reading, and how it could take weeks to get a book if it was popular, and say your grandma wouldn't buy it for you because you already had too many books and she was mad as fuck you over-piled another shelf and broke it.\n\nBut as an older Millennial, I live in constant envy of the childhood I never had that my little nieces are getting. Even as someone who was privileged enough to have had internet access in the early 90's, which was a huge luxury, you still couldn't really find what you needed on it. I couldn't find monologues for auditions, resources to learn a new language, or download a book in seconds. Every drop of knowledge was a struggle to obtain. Now we have these machines in our pocket that can teach us anything. It's fucking amazing. I'll never get over it.",

Combine that with how it's becoming a greater part of the public knowledge that it's extremely unhealthy, especially for children, and I wouldn't be surprised if social media isn't dead in a generation, either because companies stop investing money in new social media startups, or by the existing ones being regulated out of existence.\n\nAnd to be clear, that's a-OK with me.",
