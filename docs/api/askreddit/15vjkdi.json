While moving his toothbrush holder, I noticed it had about a 1/2\" of water, spit, toothpaste and who knows what else fermenting at the bottom. I made a comment on how gross it was.  Before I could clean it, my son grabs it and shoot it like it was a tequila shot. I don't know if that is the most disgusting thing I've seen, but I nearly threw up.  He thought it was funny.",

I immediately had a bad feeling about it because the dog wouldn't stop bothering at it. \n\nI stuck around close to the dog because I just kept getting the feeling something bad was going to happen. I was tinkering about, cleaning up, etc. I went around the corner to put away some towels and when I came back, the dog was pulling away ropes of bandaging.\n\nI went closer to go into the kennel and stop him, but when I got close, I realized the ropes of bandage he was pulling away were actually his intestines. He was literally eviscerating himself. I started screaming for help and quickly went in to stop the dog.\n\nLuckily the dog hadn't done any major damage and was taken immediately to the surgical suite to get patched up.

However some officers from the California Highway Patrol ended up disseminating pictures of her body to their friends/co-workers and the photos got around so much both as physical copies and on the Internet that they eventually were seen by her parents and sister.  From what I understand, if you've ever seen the pictures, they will burn in you brain for the rest of your life.
