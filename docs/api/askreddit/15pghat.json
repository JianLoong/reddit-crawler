Yes I count alcohol as a hard drug, sorry everyone. It‚Äôs poison with little to no benefit with a high chance for addiction. If you can have 1 drink on 1 day and not drink again, alright I mean I won‚Äôt judge that‚Äôs fine. But if you can‚Äôt? Better stop now. Just smoke weed instead.

   "message": "1. The secret to happiness is to not care what others think of you. Be your own person. \n2. Even if you have to sit down with a legal pad and pen in a quiet place over the course of a weekend, decide what kind of person you want to be in your 40s or 50s in terms of accomplishments, priorities, you name it. You don't need a plan. You don't even need a precise idea. But you need to have a sense of direction and some concrete steps in that direction. Keep working on it until something really resonates with you. Because there are few things sadder than people who, in their forties, wake up and say, \"This isn't what I wanted to do with my life.\"\n3. Regarding #2. Don't worry about the money. Instead, if you figure out what you want to do, pursue it with absolutely everything you've got. Become really good at whatever it is, and the money will eventually follow. Do not let anyone--your family, your friends, your teachers, whoever--tell you that you can't do it. What the hell do they know? \n4. Regarding #3. Don't be shy. Ask for help. Ask for advice. Knock on doors. Cultivate mentors. Be relentlessly curious. Read everything you possibly can. Never coast, never turn down a good chance to learn. Never assume you know everything, because you never, ever will. And THAT'S OKAY. Life is a collaboration at all times. Everybody knows something, and nobody knows everything. \n5. Time is the stuff life is made of. Don't waste it. Sure, binge on Netflix or play a video game every once in a while. Just don't make a habit of it. Make lists of things you want to get done and be good at crossing things off. And never waste an opportunity to meet someone new or try something new. You never know what or who will become your lifelong passion or friendship. \n6. I read something that, looking back, makes total sense to me: You are the sum total of the five people with whom you spend the most time. Be careful whom you choose as your friends. \n7. Never spend time with someone who makes you feel bad about yourself. Walk away. And the surefire test of character is this: Watch how that person treats the waiter, the counter help at the dry cleaner, and anyone else in a similar position. Because in six months that's how that person will be treating you. \n8. With that in mind, treat everyone you encounter with kindness, consideration, and your attention above all. Be just as good at listening as you are at talking.  \n9. Have a belief system. I don't mean that in a religious sense. I mean that in terms of your values, what's important to you. \n10. Never be afraid to try something new. \n11. Do not be in a hurry to be in a relationship. If it happens naturally, great. Some people are really lucky to find their significant others early on in life. But don't force matters. Be your own person rather than expect someone else to complete you, for that is a terrible burden to impose on someone. Avoid one-night stands, too. I've known many a guy wind up writing child support checks because he had a weekend special with someone he really didn't like all that much. Believe it or not, there are more important things in life than an orgasm. \n12. Take care of your money. Learn all the financial tools available to you and how to leverage them correctly. Pay your bills on time. Know your credit score. Don't buy things you don't need. Oh, and buy Apple when it's $6 a share in 1997(?). \n13. Stay away from drugs. Exercise. And eat right. It's the only body you'll ever get. \n14. Courage is the foundation of all happiness. Be brave in thought, word, and deed.",
