Not at all ugly or anything, but definitely not what youâ€™d picture when you think of the words hot / hunky / model etc. Heâ€™s short, extra skinny, has questionable teeth, and a part of his face is kinda messed up from an accident years ago.\n\nHe has a lot of amazing qualities. Heâ€™s really fucking smart, knows a ton about a lot of stuff, has a lot of interesting hobbies and is good at them, super handy, very well spoken, sorta weird in a way that Iâ€™m into, and very athletic (though you wouldnâ€™t know by looking at him because again heâ€™s on the shorter side and thin as a rail).\n\nWe met through mutual friends and I didnâ€™t think anything of him the first time we met. But I kept bumping into him at social events, and the more I got to know him, the more I liked him. Now Iâ€™m insanely attracted to him and I like him just how he is.",

I'm genuinely nice to her, and I remember things she says and act on them regularly. And I don't mean chores or whatever, I mean things like whe we started dating she mentioned she likes flowers but not \"I fucked up\" flowers, so every 2 or 3 months o get her a little bouquet to show her how much I appreciate her..even if we are tight on money I'll get a 25$ one, if we we are doing ok I'll get a nicer one., but NEVER if it could be precieved as \"i messed up\" flowers. I'll show up at her work with a coffee, a couple times a week which makes her feel special as well.  I try cooking new things and when she says she really likes something I'll try sevral versions of that amd add them to the rotation. She has skin problems and when her hands start bothering her I'll do both the cooking and dishes (usually we split it fifty fifty) for a few days so she can heal. \n\n\nJust listen guys. Act on it, nd don't stop being nice, compassionate and loving. Little gestures that never stop can be the difference.",
