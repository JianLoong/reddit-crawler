During me first year I was hardly able to lift any sort of weight because I was super skinny and wasnt eating right and I trained alone so I didnt have a friend to spot me. I remember doing bench press and I decided to push myself and try to lift with 10kg  (10 on both sides, just to be clear). As soon as I put my hands on the bar I noticed a small group around me. After doing 6 reps I was almost failing, but one of them rushed behind the bar and kept telling me \"Lets go dude! I know you got one more in ya!\". I was able to do 5 more reps and afterwards the group started cheering, patting me on my back and high-fiving me. It felt super nice.",
