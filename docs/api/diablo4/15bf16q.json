The journey asks us to kill Echo of Lilith in the Archives of Issalia.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[Last Chapter of Season Journey](https://preview.redd.it/8ra9lv0twkeb1.png?width=793\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=41dcab93ae74218a52c10d8e9f85d248f5f08de1)\n\nNow, that actually made me interested, so after a quick google search, I found a leaked video footage of the Closed Endgame Beta of someone actually going inside the dungeon, fighting monsters, etc.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Inside of Archives of Issalia](https://preview.redd.it/9qnmn3wjxkeb1.png?width=1920\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=409ecac8b42a2a4c6080dca56bad2069fe808baf)\n\nAfter checking out a bit more of the video, it clearly shows the entrance around the border of Scosglen and Dry Steppes, near Farobru\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[Closed Beta Screenshot of the map and entrance](https://preview.redd.it/xzfmt9o5ykeb1.png?width=1920\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=a931741e4b0d6f387e098c773e53093c89893e11)\n\nNow, if you check it out ingame, that are is clearly off the map\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current map of the area](https://preview.redd.it/atmdotrnykeb1.png?width=1920\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=d7625aaf009b2b1d48d912dfbfcd2b174a025e86)\n\nAnd the way to get up there is obviously on the map too\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stairs are obviously there, but blocked](https://preview.redd.it/0ou1is1vykeb1.png?width=1920\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=120216b42d4ddd0945c5bda2af21cc8212db7be9)\n\n[Stairs are obviously there, but blocked](https://preview.redd.it/5ja6e1pxykeb1.png?width=1920\u0026amp;format=png\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;s=61dd6a3203509c9a9524eefb1559ce58c36e509f)\n\nWhat's your opinion on this? Did Blizzard just replace Echo of Lilith and took the dungeon out of the game, or could it be the entrance to the Capstone Dungeon to let us into the previously leaked/datamined World Tier 5?",
