We nearly never actually live up to our own values, but even acknowledging that things are really messed up right now, they're still stubbornly better than they were before, and I think it's reasonable to think they'll keep getting gradually better over time. At least until new, different problems (or even the same ones just showing up differently) come up and we'll fight over how to solve those, do nothing and maybe let them get worse for awhile, and then gradually those will get solved too. And we continually tend to believe we actually *can* and *ought* to be better. Americans are often stubbornly optimistic even when things are pretty bad.\n\nAlso, no matter what some of our more insane citizens think, and despite how hard it is to actually do sometimes, anyone can potentially be an American. We're not like Japan or China that rejects immigrants, or like France who forces them to become essentially French. Once you're a citizen, You're as American as any natural born citizen. In fact, some of the most devoted patriotic Americans I've known have been first generation immigrants. That's because at its core, America isn't a geographic nation or an ethnicity, it's a political idea. \n\nAmerica is also a place where you can build something from nothing. We encourage entrepreneurship. It's telling that immigrants here have a higher rate of small businesses ownership than natural born citizens. People come here *to* build something for themselves.\n\nThese things all exist in some way in other countries, but America is, if not unique then at least in a small minority of countries where those things all exist at once.",
