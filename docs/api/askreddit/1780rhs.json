Needless to say everyone was ready to rush this idiot but before anyone could even shift a foot under themselves- teach pops him right in the face, just a quick jab- the muscle memory of an old boxer.\nIt was glorious, the kid fell on his ass so quickly and before the he could even react he was swarmed and pulled far away by the rest of the class.\nAt first the teacher was ‘suspended’ and there was talk of him being charged- but literally the entire class testified on his behalf and it was somehow swept under the rug, teach was able to retire early and the shit head was suspended.

They gave the code to the 4 local kids so we could get there and unlock the doors and open the bays and get trucks started and ready to roll.\n\nOne night the class idiot decided to go into their department and play “pranks” on them. Took all their hoses off the trucks, strung them around the bays and looped them through the axles, discharged all the foam out of the main engine, and screwed with everyone’s bunker gear by swapping boots and removing the liners of structural gear among other things.\n\nNaturally it ended very bad when a call came in for a structure fire and when the actual firefighters showed up the entire house was in such disarray and no truck could even leave.  They ended up calling a town 20 minutes away to respond.  Two people passed away in the fire.  Naturally all four of us were the top suspects and it didn’t take the police long to figure it out as the place was full of surveillance cameras. He was arrested, his parents got the bill for all the damages, and we never saw him nor his family again after that, they just skipped the area and vanished overnight.\n\nThe fire department killed almost all ties with the Explorer Program and allowing us to respond to minor calls.
