Too many opinions and misinformation.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Most of the responses below are not addressing the main issue I'm bringing up.  It's not about which tool you use to access it, or their capitialistic tendancies to gummy up their UI.  It's about the \"information\" aka the data that has built up over the decades.  There's too much of it, and search engines and AI sometimes cannot distinguish between the old and the new.  \n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll give a small anectodal example:  I like to play Ark Survival Evolved.  There's a lot of content and mechanics to learn about the game and most players like myself will find themselves searching the web for information on how to do some thing like most games.  Say I want to learn how to tame a Sinomacrops.  I go to any search engine and it spits out a Youtube video from a year ago - seems new enough it must be correct.  Its wrong because there have been dozens, maybe hundreds, of patches since it was published and one of those random small patches hot fixed this method (What? you can't place torches around them anymore???) and now it actually screws up the tame.  Hours wasted, rage quit.  If only I was served the correct information.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be checking out the duck duck go and the chatgpt though - thanks for the tips",
