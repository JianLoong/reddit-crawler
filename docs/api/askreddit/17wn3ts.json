A mix of small town and big city. Countless great restaurants that had been there for decades and legendary venues for music. \n\nThen around ‘07, the lofts started being built. The weirdness slowly started to fade as the artists who made up the town and uniqueness, had to relocate because of the influx of Californians and cost of living increases. Gentrification of the east side replaced minorities and poor people with more lofts and high rise apartments. \n\nI still visit Austin for shows, but I no longer recognize it. It feels the soul has left and now there’s fancy restaurants and boutiques and rich hipsters and tech bros. No more gutter punks on the strip. The homeless have made their homes all over downtown, only to be relocated when SXSW or ACL brings in people from all over the world.",
