Nope, he wanted to offer me his roll of toilet paper for a pillow.  He introduced himself as the \"Sac City Psycho\". He told me he would watch over me to make sure nobody fucked with me, cause he could tell I did not have much experience in jail.  Now looking back on it, I guess for a few hours there, I was his bitch.  \n\nSuper nice guy tho, 10/10 would be his bitch again",

My spine turned to ice when I saw his eyes look at me, they were almost sunken into his face, as if he was peeking our from behind a portrait. He moved like a cat stalking prey.\n\nOver time he made his way over to me and made polite conversation, but his words felt disjointed, almost like he was translating them before speaking them. There was nothing aggressive or insulting about anything he was doing. In fact, he was quite polite. but everything about this guy was setting off every nerve I had. He was even smiling through most of it, but it felt as if his lips were stapled back.",

Broke another one’s nose for asking him to not pull their hair. So many concussions. Thousands of dollars in damages to both company property and staff’s: televisions, windows, doors, gaming systems, windshields, glasses, phones, teeth, bones… Literally every escalation every single day ended up being an attempted murder. We could, on a good day, expect 2-4 or them per shift. Sometimes lasting hours. \n\nThey got mad at us if we called the police to help us. They didn’t want him to “look bad” in the community. We weren’t officially forbidden from personally pressing charges but it was not encouraged. Everyone did everything to make sure he never faced any consequences. For the two staff he pulverized, he had to draw a picture to say he was sorry (he was almost 14). He finished the picture, looked the staff with him in the eye and said, “I’m not sorry. I’m glad I did it. I wish I’d hurt them worse. I wish I’d killed them.”\n\nIt was my job to work with him. When he wasn’t in a rage, he had his decent moments. In one calm conversation, we were playing Legos or something, I asked him if he’d like to talk about some ways to avoid hurting people when he gets angry.\n\nThe kid looks me dead in the eye and said, “no. I don’t want to stop hurting people. I like hurting people.”\n\nI asked him why.\n\nHe shrugged, “I just like it. It’s fun.” I believed him.",

Threats of physical and bodily violence because of what my lying manipulative mother told these officers, I was locked in jail and they did exactly what they said they would\n\n\n\nIf anyone wants more context I will give it, this is gonna get buried tho\n\n\nEdit one: since so many have asked, here’s the context, when I was 15 and living home with my mother, she’d constantly try to kick me out (never succeed at all because it’s illegal and she could have went to jail for child neglect) well this particular night I was accused of hitting a kid across the street and breaking his nose, which is relatively common in those days with me but this once I didn’t do it! Eel she called the cops on me and the other parents tried to press charges, when the cops get to my home my mother spouts lies about how I’ve repeatedly hit her (I have never) and how I’m extremely disrespectful and mean to her (which i was not). The cops believed her and turned on me, throwing me in the car with cuffs on and booking me in jail for 3 weekends before I was sent to juvenile justice court and found guilty of assault, anyways on that first night in the county jail the arresting officers came\nin and said i was being transported (which was a lie) and they took me in a holding cell where i was cuffed to a table and beat down by two big grown men, needless to say they made the promises come true that night and in fact i did never forget that night (no they were never charged and no i didnt get a chance to tell my mom because my dad was given custody and i moved back with him to chicago)",

His eyes were emotionless and dead, like looking at a bad painting of a doll's eyes.

I immediately wanted to leave. \n\nAfter my friend and I got back into the car I told her that guy was bad news and her friend needed to break up with him. She asked me why and I just said I didn't know, there was just something wrong with him. A week later she did indeed dump him (he started freaking her out somehow, I don't know the details), and I never heard a thing about that guy again.

The second he walked through the door, everyone I worked with and was at the bar said they felt cold. Dude had incredibly sunken eyes, pale white skin, dingy dirty hair, and visibly sharp looking teeth. If I was to explain what a mako shark as a human would be, that’s this guy. He said he was passing through and was looking for “stuff ordinary people can’t find” then proceeded to show photos on his phone of odd areas he had been to previously. Nothing was off about the photos, but every one I saw gave me more chills. Nothing was happening, no one was there, but everything had this feeling of “I’m not supposed to be here”. The dude left and asked me to follow him on Instagram, which I did. He posted last a few years ago up in Jackson Hole and said he’d be staying off for a while. Odd dude. We all were quite relieved when his cab showed up.",

They were as devoid of emotion as a reptile and they looked at you with this intensity that showed he was storing up every detail about your personality, clothing, manner and I guess, weaknesses. He said he would fly into a country, eliminate his target and be gone in 2 hours. I knew without a doubt if he got the order on me, he'd walk up, put a gun to my forehead, pull the trigger and walk off without even blinking. He was terrifying.",

   "message": "I led a rifle platoon in Iraq at the tail end of the surge. Quiet sector down in the Central-South, in an almost exclusively Shia sector. Our area was where members of Shia militant groups from places like Hillah would go to hide out when the heat from the Iraqi Police/SOF got too hot.\n\nOur units area of operation expanded to encompass a new town, and I was tasked to go meet up with the local Iraqi Police commander and have him take me by some of the known bed down locations for these guys, if only to get an idea where they were and send the message that we were keeping an eye on things. We jump into our vehicles out the front of the police station and have the IPs drive us to the first house on our list, the family house of a known bomb facilitator. They drive around the corner and go may 20 meters. The first house? Shared a wall with the Iraqi Police station. Typical Iraqi small town street, stores and houses on a reasonably tight street with lots of people milling about; kids playing soccer, old guys sitting out at a cafe, adults going to and from the stores, that kind of thing. \n\nI get out and notice a guy sitting on the step of the target house. I walk up and notice he immediately looks nervous, looks behind him to his house, but then calms down and meets me. Go to shake the guys hand and, well, he doesn’t really have one anymore. Badly burned, with missing fingers. Shake his hand and notice just how much hate the guy had in his eyes. Introduces himself as the targets cousin, and…presents me with a valid Iraqi Army ID card. Claims to have “burned his hand defusing a bomb for his unit.” Well this is 2009, the Iraqi state has sovereignty for the province at this point so it’s not like I can readily detain anyone on my own as an American. We’re supposed to be there in an advise and assist capacity only, helping to train up the Iraqi Police as a force to handle security for when the US eventually do leave. So I turn around to look behind me to go check with the Iraqi Police commander if he has anything else about the guy…\n\nStreet is fucking _deserted_. My platoon has forted up around our vehicles, and the Iraqi Police look like they’re going to shit themselves. IP commander is *not* getting out of his truck. Turn back around to look at the dude, he still has that look of hate. Not much I can do at this point, so we mount up and leave.\n\n90% sure I met a Shia militant group bomb maker that day, and given the group he probably belonged to he had likely participated in any number of bombing attacks. If it had been pre-turnover we probably could have rolled him up, but now it was up to the Iraqi Government and they didn’t want to do anything about it. Hell, they were scared shitless. So that’s how it ended. Our tour was actually pretty quiet which was a blessing. A few badly failed IED attacks and some rockets, nothing major.\n\nReally had to have a chat with my platoon about letting me know if things were going south while I was engaging with the locals through.",
