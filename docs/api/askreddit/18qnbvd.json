But I don't like most of the non-Grinch moments, I don't like giving him a generic bullied-kid backstory (I say this as a generic bullied kid in real life), and the set design really had issues trying to make it both look like a cramped town full of shitty people and a whimsical little village of happy-go-lucky Christmas fans.",
