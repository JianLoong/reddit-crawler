 "selftext": "I have this coworker… they drive an old pickup truck and also a used 2015 Honda CRV. When driving the CRV, they ALWAYS double park and block other customers and employees out of two parking spots. I’ve brought it up with our store and also with them directly- nothing gets done. So, I asked them to stop: and they said they “no, I don’t f-ing care. Get over it.” \n\nSo I don’t care to keep their stem caps and use them to take out 2-6psi every time their car is double parked. AITA?",
