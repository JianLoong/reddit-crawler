   "message": "To name only a few times \nOnce I was at the top of a building, and of course the suicide hotline didn‚Äôt help and hung up again, so I was left with my thoughts. Jumping was very alluring, but I realized that people had tried and failed to kill me so many times before, and situations had turned near fatal yet I‚Äôd gotten away, and to end it all because my brain wasn‚Äôt working with me would be to help them, so I spited them all and left. \nAnother time, I was on my way to a pier that I was planning on driving off, and I called my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù at the time. I explained the situation and how I felt, and instead of helping he told me ‚Äúnice crocodile tears‚Äù and said he‚Äôd tell my parents and hung up on me. After all my experiences of being in his place, I realized my kind of support was not the norm and decided that for my friends that did treat me well, I should try to stick around so they could have the kind of support that a suicidal/traumatized/depressed person should.\n\nLast but definitely not least, the day my (now ex) girlfriend attempted (sorry it‚Äôs long)\nI lived with my girlfriend while we were both 20, and had just become independent. There were a lot of things wrong with the relationship, but in this case the important bad part was that she had fallen in love with another guy who had the same name as me, and admitted it to me. All I did in response was say that I wanted to think about how to handle this, never said anything about a breakup, still slept next to her that night. The next morning, we wake up together, she leaves bed to go to the bathroom, I stay put on my phone. About 10-15 minutes later, I hear *boomboomboom* ‚Äú____ Sherriffs Office, open up!‚Äù I went to the door to find a whole team of emergency response personnel, from sherriffs to EMS to firefighters, police kinda pushed me to the side and asked me about her after I said she was in the bathroom. I somehow immediately spotted her suicide note, which of course was only half written. They forced the door open I think, then pretty much dragged her to the ambulance. It was only after that I realized what had really happened. She hadn‚Äôt said a word to me, but did text one friend on the other side of the US what she was planning to do. Luckily, this friend had our address and called 911. My girlfriend got held under a 5150, and couldn‚Äôt make it to her sisters wedding, which I of course had to be the one to let them know she wouldn‚Äôt be there and they‚Äôd need a new photographer. Plus she got very mad that I saw friends that wanted to help me out and talk me through all this, and held it over my head for months. As you can imagine, this lead to many attempts of my own, some of which I‚Äôve talked myself out of by remembering how much of my time I already gave to people that weren‚Äôt worth it, and now it‚Äôs time for me to do better, not stop and give up.\n\nSorry I know that‚Äôs a long post, but I hope my experiences can help someone else.",

I got drunk as hell and the feels took over, I had been distraught for months at this point but no one I felt comfortable enough to talk about it with. Got to the point where I took my ak pattern rifle and loaded it up, sat at the top of the stairs and waited for the right moment to go through with it. Had music blasting so any noise was drowned out pretty well. So around comes like 2-3am and roommate gets home early for reasons I forget, and his account of the situation is seeing me at the top of the stairs with my eyes closed, rifle under chin and thumb on the trigger. He bolts up the stairs and knocks the rifle to my left side, either causing it to fire or as I pulled the trigger. This spurred me to go off on him trying to fight him for my gun back so I could actually go through with it. This lasted long enough that he got tired enough to resort to hitting me with a bat to put me down, so the next morning I wake up massively hungover, back so sore I can hardly move, and major hearing damage in my left ear. All in all, bat or not, he saved my life that night four years ago. I e since been doing significantly better and I‚Äôm grateful for his actions that night. Gonzo, if you‚Äôre out there, Thank You.",

She told me if I were to kill myself, she'll consider it as well, because she had suicide thoughts from time to time too. I was shocked, I don't know if she said that so I wouldn't off myself or if she was serious, but it's something I wouldn't want to risk. At the time, my little sister was 7. I do not want to put her through that trauma, she looked up to me, ya know. So my mom and I promised to live for each other. \n\nIt's been 3 or 4 years and we're doing better now.",

On the day she planned to do it she heard that a new season of South Park was coming soon and she genuinely felt that South Park was the only thing that made her happy, so she waited for the new season. In the meantime she was able to work on herself and she eventually didn‚Äôt do it.",

I think about it almost every day; how the people I love would react if they walked in on my corpse. Or how they would react to the news of my death. It makes me cry every time, too lol.\n\nI know that I‚Äôm so so fortunate to have people in my life that worry about me like that, because not everybody is *nearly* that lucky. And I always feel so selfish whenever I feel that way.\n\nLuckily I‚Äôm out of that funk, and in a much better state currently.",

Right underneath the kitchen sink. I saw no future for me. I had no reason to believe that anything would get better. I hated being alive. But when the time came, I sat on the floor with the chemicals in front of me and I.... I couldn't do it.  And I don't know why.  I didn't feel fear. I didn't care if death impacted anyone. \n\nBut I couldn't do it. No voice in my head. I don't pray to any Gods. But I just sat there looking at these chemicals. I didn't question myself but I just at there. And eventually just put them back.  To this day, my parents have no idea.",
