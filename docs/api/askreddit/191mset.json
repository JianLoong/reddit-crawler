   "message": "Mutt Lange. Lange was responsible for a lot of the sounds in rock music in the 80s.\n\nHighway to Hell and Back in Black? He produced that. Foreigner 4? Him.\n\nPyromania, the album that all the \"hair metal\" bands went on to try and emulate? Him. Hysteria, the album with zero filler and seven hit singles (more, if the band wasn't suffering from success)? He did that.\n\nAnd that's not to take away from the talent of all the artists he worked with but, for a while, everything he touched turned to gold.\n\nEdit: as others responding to me show, there's plenty of examples of great albums he's produced, and he's still making more and in different genres. He's worked with AC/DC, Britney Spears, Bryan Adams, Backstreet Boys, Carrie Underwood, Celine Dion, Def Leppard, Maroon 5, Muse, and Shania Twain to name a few. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more successful and influential producer.\n\nArguably, it was also Lange's perfectionist and pop-oriented approach that led directly to grunge as the pushback to 80s music",

   "message": "Motley Crue was the hair metal kings, Prince had his hands in just about everything else during the decade. Throw in Michael Jackson and pop is covered. Some of the greats were just hitting their stride like Elton John. Musically speaking, the 80’s was a great decade. There was something for everyone regardless of your musical tastes. The 90’s carried that vibe over and the addition of grunge was rock’s saving grace at the time. Maybe not a saving grace as much as a hostile takeover but the grunge artists never wanted it that way.",
