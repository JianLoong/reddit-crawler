 "selftext": "Title basically sums it up. My ex wife leans toward “alternative” medical treatments and is skeptical of vaccines. She read the books Vaccine Friendly Plan and is convinced that many vaccines are unsafe and harmful. To date, my daughter has no vaccinations and will turn 2 in January. Her mom has been making excuse after excuse to avoid vaccinations (want to wait until she’s older, she has a runny nose right now, doctor has no availability, etc). \n\nI’m at the point where I’m going to take my daughter in without her moms knowledge to get her up to date on vaccinations. Am I the asshole?",
