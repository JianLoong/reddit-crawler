 "title": "AITA for making my husband pay for a new hearing aid after he accidentally broke mine?",
 "selftext": "I (F29) have been deaf since birth and use a hearing aid. My husband (M28) knows this and has always been very understanding of my condition. We keep our finances separate but split household expenses equally. Both of us are a bit short on money at the moment due to some extra expenses in the past few months for our daughter (F7).\n\nLast night, I was in the bathroom and left my hearing aid on the table. My husband started fiddling with my device, as he often does. He has this annoying habit of messing with everything he sees, even if it's not his. He says it's just curiosity, but I've asked him several times to stop doing it.\n\nWhat happened was that he ended up dropping my hearing aid on the floor and accidentally stepping on it, breaking it. He apologized, saying it was an accident, but I was really upset. I told him he had to buy me a new hearing aid because mine was very expensive, and I couldn't afford another one.\n\nHe was surprised and said he had saved that money to fix his car. He said I was being unfair and that we could find another solution. I told him he was responsible for breaking my device and that he had to face the consequences.\n\nWe argued for a while, and he eventually gave me the money to buy a new hearing aid, but he was very resentful. I felt guilty for making him spend so much money, but at the same time, I believe he was irresponsible with my device and should take responsibility for what he did. AITA?",
