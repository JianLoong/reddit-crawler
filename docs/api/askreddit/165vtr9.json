They caught something that could’ve killed me just in time. The cyst was growing for years and I had no idea. A regular Pap smear could not detect something like this. I went to the hospital because I had been fainting for days prior (with constant pain in my stomach/abdominal area), and also had a seizure two days before and had to go to the hospital for that too (I have epilepsy). I KNEW something was off. I just knew. I went back to the hospital yet again. This wasn’t just seizure-like symptoms. I was in severe pain. So there I was, having an ultrasound for something unrelated to my ovaries (the doctors had their theories on whatever my pain was coming from, and quite honestly I forget what the fuck they thought it was). And they found the cyst. Now I likely cannot have my own child because I have another cyst on my remaining ovary. My life hasn’t been the same since that surgery. And my life hasn’t been the same when I got a concussion in 2019 from falling down a flight of stairs, that lead to me develop seizures. Yet, I’m still here. I’m alive.
