Back at the end of 2020 I was having trouble getting in touch with a vendor we had a contract with to do some work around one of our offices. Nothing big. I figured he just ghosted us, so I began looking for another vendor who could take over the work.\n\nAfter 2 months of radio silence, vendor 1 calls me out of the blue and was clearly very drunk and crying at 1pm on a week day. Turns out he had gotten covid, was hospitalized, got blood clots in both legs, and had to have them both amputated.\n\nHe called me while I was at work and told me his whole life story. I ended up staying on the phone with him for about 30-45 minutes and I helped him track down a grief counselor. Hopefully he went. I still wonder how he's doing some times.",
