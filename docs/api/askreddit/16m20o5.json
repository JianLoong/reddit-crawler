What you need: kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, mayonnaise (the nicest you have or like), sweet pickled relish, mustard, finely diced celery, and of course your tuna of choice (I like chunk light in oil, but whatever works for you).\n\nDrain the tuna very well and put it in a bowl. Add a few dashes of salt and a grind or two of pepper, mix well. How much mayo you like is really up to you, add how much you like (if you're not sure, start small and add some more as you go). To the mayo blob, add at least one heaping tablespoon of sweet relish (more to taste) and a tiny dash of mustard, mix first the blob until it's nice and consistent, and then fold in the tuna (some tuna bits get into the blob, don't sweat it). Check how it tastes, once you have it right, mix in the celery.\n\nHow to serve: If you really want to go deluxe, thinly slice some tomato or cucumber and salt them a little bit, just let them rest with it about five minutes. Make some lightly toasted bread (I recommend whole wheat or rye bread), don't toast it too much or else it will scrape the roof of your mouth. Add the desired amount of tuna salad to the toast, add a layer of the cucumbers or tomatoes on top, and then add the second slice of bread. \n\nServe with the sandwich sliced crosswise in triangles.\n\nNote: Sometimes, I leave out the celery and add some halved kalamata olives. This is also pretty sensational.",
