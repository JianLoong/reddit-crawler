(in general, I don't really like him, but as far as he's not fucking around like some other privileged overly-rich people do, I don't hate him either)\n\nThe only unfortunate thing is that he always plays the same kind of characters. It's always some cheesy over-exaggerated and a bit pathetic comedy (for me). Similar to Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Steve Carell. Or the famous group of actors and actresses of American Pie, who seemingly cannot / don't want to get any role at all.\n\nRemember, if you hate (or like, I'm not here to judge) villain characters, the actor / actress did a great job at acting.",
