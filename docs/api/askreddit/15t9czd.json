A rental car company did ruin my Disney Vacation.\n\nWe set off for Disney World for New Years and tripled checked everything was booked and set. Flights, hotels, car rental. The day of our flight we even called the rental car company to confirm the vehicle availability.\n\nOnce we got to the airport, we waited for the rental car company's shuttle bus.\n\n\"It'll be there every 15 minutes.\"\n\n20 minutes passed. We called. Waited another 15 minutes. Called. Rinse and repeat for hours and hours on end. We already paid hundreds of dollars to rent the car.\n\nEventually, we finally got on the line with someone who told us they weren't renting out any cars that day. We got a full refund and had to Uber our way around.\n\nIt completely messed up our schedule for the first day, so we didn't spend much time in our first park. On top of it, it was SO DIFFICULT to get Uber to get back to the hotel. We'd literally get home every night between 12-2am, so we'd be exhausted the next day. Plus, they jacked up their prices.\n\nWe still had a good experience, but it was so much more stressful than it had to be. We booked everything months in advance.",

The whole village hates you because they can't go to the pub. The pub owner hates you for ruining his pub. The recovery dude hates you because the fire was so hot the remains of the car are sunken into the asphalt which has hardened again overnight. The owner of the parking lot hates you for ruining his parking lot. Your insurance hates you because you just bought the car an hour before with the intention of driving it back and importing it into your own country and you managed to insure it on the VIN so they have to pay for all the damages. Local police hates you because it was a V5 vehicle but still on English plates and with foreign insurance.\n\nSource: Me.\n\n(To be honest. The townsfolk were absolutely amazing when they got over the fact that they didn't get their Friday night beers and fish 'n chips. We had a place to stay before the fire was out and got an amazing breakfast the next morning.)\n\nOther than that, I really need some like-minded people around me when traveling. The way I travel it happens all the time that strangers are part of the group and as an introvert that can be quite tiring. It can be nice to just sit apart from the others with one or two others for an hour or so after a long day of having to interact with many, many people.",
