That one moment you catch where their eyes look at you and express true surprise and gratitude and then you get that warm head rush and elation that you‚Äôve made a genuine difference. I know it‚Äôs not completely selfless, but it‚Äôs a great feeling. \n\nAnyone had fantasies about winning the lottery and just secretly giving it away as tips and gifts to strangers? that single mum doing it tough pulling 12hr days trying to make ends meet, or that old timer who works constantly but can‚Äôt retire because he can‚Äôt afford it?
