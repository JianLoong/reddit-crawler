As long as the term is being used in the descriptive sense and not being used as an insult, it is in no way offensive. \n\nFor example, if you're making fun of someone for being fat, then you'd be using it as an insult - this is actual fat shaming and should not be condoned, which is why in that context it would be offensive.\n\nBut if you're describing someone clinically, it is not offensive. For example, I was asked to describe my uncle to someone who had to find him without having met him before. I would describe him as tall, fat stomach, wearing a long sleeved striped shirt and short white hair. In this case, it's a descriptive term only. \n\nFat shaming should never be considered okay, but using the word descriptively is not fat shaming. It's not an inherently offensive word and we should not pretend it is, it's a word where context is everything.",
