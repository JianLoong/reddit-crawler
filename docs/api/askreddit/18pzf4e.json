They \"know\" how to run a business and what to do to be successful. They talk about their ill-defined dream.\n\nThen, one day, something clicks. A new business starts making bank and it's the last piece of the puzzle. If it's a new bakery that everyone talks about, then the secret to wealth is opening a bakery. If it's a pet shop, open a pet shop. If it's some useless digital start up that make South Park's Washington Redskin episode look like a documentary… you know the drill by now. They genuinely believe playin catch up to a successful business is solid entrepreneurial strategy\n\nAnd so, they open their \"dream\" business. They know jack shit about administration, but they **know** if you serve a good product, than people will come. They pay their employees like shit and then complain they're just there to get a check and don't give a fuck about their \"dream\" of being their own boss. If, by some stroke of luck, they are somewhat successful, they can't supply their demand, have no growth strategy and end up smothered by their own success. And then, when it's all said and done and their business went down the drain, they'll blame everyone but themselves. The fault is the government forcing them to pay liveable wages and their former employees for not giving enough to the company\n\nI have no pity or sympathy for their plight",

If a person makes that mistake once and realizes what went wrong... different story. I'm talking about the people who legitimately, truly do not care. Drunk driving is one of the most dangerous things a person could ever do. Dangerous for yourself, dangerous for anybody who is on the road with you. I've known people, from either young college party kids to much older people who should be well established in life who just do not care and feel like they have the right. \n\nI don't care if they get into a crash and hurt themselves.
