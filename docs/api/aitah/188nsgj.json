 "selftext": "I caught her cheating, but I’m trying to forgive her, you know, “Forgive and ye shall be forgiven” and all that. She wants to make up, well duh, of course you do, YOU’RE THE ONE THAT CHEATED! 🙄🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ I didn’t leave her and I want to work it out, but I’m just not ready yet for make-up sex. This woman has the nerve to act like I’M an asshoIe for denying her sex, affection, etc. It’s almost like she’s telling me to “get over it already”, but if it were the other way around she would’ve left me. AITAH?",
