Once the babies are freed they are paired with wildlife to be taught survival skills. \n\nBenefits:\n\n1) Dad's and Mom's finish together.  \n2) Mom's don't have to endure child birth.  \n3) We will definitely plant more trees which is an overall win.  \n4) SNB will be born with an orange glow to their skin. This will be called the Amber Aura.  \n5) We will learn to communicate with animals.  \n6) There is a Tree Ent named Rejjie.",
