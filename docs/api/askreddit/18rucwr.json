Now, I embrace the stumbles, the goofy jokes, the awkward moments. That's life, man, and it's pretty awesome if you let it be.",

Do the thing to show those who doubted out how wrong they were. The second is more: \"You only live once, may as well have some fun stories to tell\"\n\nThe people I surrounded myself with also play a big role in enjoying life. Chosen family can be more important to some than their birth family.",
