Turns out, they made a whole bunch of songs I’d heard before. It would have never occurred to me they were all by the same band! Either I assumed they were all by different bands, or (more likely) I never thought very much about them at all, because they were just generic popular songs. \n\nAnd I’m not implying here that generic means bad. I actually don’t mind most of their songs. It’s just that, to me, they’ll always be synonymous with “random popular band.”",
