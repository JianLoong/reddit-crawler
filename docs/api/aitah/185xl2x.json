 "selftext": "(58 f) I have asked my husband (61M) for the last 40 years (40th anniversary coming up early next year)not to make comments on the food I am eating or have in my plate. He is a good man and a great adventure partner for our almost full time travel. He, however, says he forgets when he mentions things and says that I need to get over it. He knows I am writing here for opinions as he honestly feels that him forgetting isn’t a big deal and I feel that because it is so important to me he should prioritize remembering. \n\nI have a history of food issues streaming from my mom being bulimic as a child. She had challenges with food and unfortunately it did spill over to me. I counted every calorie I put in my mouth until my mid 30s and used to weigh myself daily and allow my weight to dictate how I felt about myself. I have worked hard to put it all behind me but every once in a while it rears its ugly head. When it does I work through it and I have never let it go to the extremes of being unhealthy. AITA for expecting that he remembers and that he does not talk about my food (amount, how much I have eaten, calories…).",
