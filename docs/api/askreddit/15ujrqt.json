It used to be quite a special thing to be able to take good photos.\n\nI have been a full time freelance photographer for about 9 years and I’m finally having to throw in the towel because no-one wants to pay anymore. There’s too many cowboys who buy a nice camera and undercut your prices significantly while putting out dog shit work. Your average person doesn’t care about the quality of the work enough anymore to justify it being an affordable career, except for those at the very top. It has just gotten worse and worse and worse.\n\nOne of the things my dad used to make bank doing was photographing damaged shipping containers (we lived near a major port). He’d get called out short notice and be expected to do a 1hr turnaround (this was obviously in the film and darkroom days) so the shipping companies could send off the prints for insurance claims. He’d get paid like, £1,000 a go to do that because the contents were so valuable they could justify the expense to get good well lit photos. And that was in 70s money. Then digital cameras came around and any dock worker with two brain cells to rub together could do his job.\n\nMy apocalypse moment has only really just begun with photoshop ai. One of the things I used to get paid well to do is retouching, but this new tech has made it so easy that anyone who can draw a circle and click once can do jobs that would take me an hour in less than 30 seconds with no skill required whatsoever. It’s honestly pretty soul destroying watching my career and business just evaporate around me. I firmly believe that except for a few super high end guys, photography is going to become the job of the weekend warriors who do it as a side hustle. There’s just not enough money in it anymore to make a full time career justifiable.",
