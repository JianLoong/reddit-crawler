 "selftext": "Am I an asshole because I don't want to spend my birthday eating Chritmas dinner with my in-laws and adult stepchildren who treat me like crap?\n\nMy birthday is Dec 23, (which is bad enough already, I know).This year,  my husband's family has decided to have Christmas at his parents' house on the 23rd. My husband has 3 adult daughters who barely speak to me when we get together, and his parents and sister are still friends with his ex-wife. They  have even gone so far as to invite said ex-wife to family get togethers when my husband and I could not make it. \n\nThis past Thanksgiving, we hosted dinner at our house and: 1) his parents barely ate anything, saying things like , \"We don't like smoked meat\", and \"we aren't used to stuffing with sausage in it\" etc. and 2) His oldest daughter was fixing a \"to-go\" plate to take home to her boyfriend before people were even finished eating. When my husband called her out on it, she threw a hissy fit and sat on the couch sulking the rest of the evening.  3) Nobody offered to help clean up afterward. They all sat around the kitchen table drinking while my husband and I cleaned up the dinner mess. \n\nAm I an asshole for not wanting to spend my birthday around people who have repeatedly disrespected me and my feelings, make me feel like I am not even part of the family, and barely speak to me (or my daughter for that matter)? Or should I just suck it up and \"take the high road\" and be there for my husband?",
