 "selftext": "I (F, 36) co-parent my daughter (F, 5) with my ex, Eric (M, 40). Normally, we get along great and support each other. He takes her from Friday evening to Sunday evenings, and the rest of the time she is with me. Today, he texted that in January, he won’t be taking her and asked if it's okay for her to stay with me. I asked if he was going away for work, and he mentioned his parents rented a place in Hawaii for a week. I suggested he take her, as she is close to her cousins, but he claimed he could only afford one ticket, and his parents cover food expenses. I pointed out his spending on gaming consoles and fishing gear so how on earth this is a problem ?. He stopped responding, then an hour later, left a voice message crying, stating he's doing his best as a dad and feeling accused. Was I really an asshole?\n\nAdded : I realize now that I was the asshole . I assumed since his sister’s kids will be there our daughter will have a blast with them especially since she loves playing on the beach . I had no right telling him how to manage his money . I’m going to save up so I can hopefully one day take her to Disneyland . thank you ",
