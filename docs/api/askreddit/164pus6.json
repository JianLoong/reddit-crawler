I prepped that presentation as best I could but was still terrified. Before I went in, I listened to that song on a loop. It gave me strength to walk into that room like a boxer going into a must win match. A major fuck you attitude which translated to an energetic presentation. When I was done, people told me I was a natural speaker. But it was only because that Eminem song that gave me strength. After that, I had minimal fear of public speaking. Ended up loving it actually. That song changed my life. I gave a major speech to the leaders of my industry later in my career, led panels and became an executive in my industry. Because of Eminem.
