   "message": "She was unvaccinated and refused to take a covid test before seeing me. My mother was terminally ill and severely immuno-compromised, so I was absolutely trying to minimise the risk of getting covid so I could still see my Mum.\n\n\nShe refused to take a test, twice, despite kind and calm requests and explanations, on the basis that she \"didn't want to get a sinus infection.\" (This was in the time of nasal swabs, not mouth swabs, for covid tests. You know, those nasal swabs that are sterile and can't cause infection.)\n\n\nI'm 100% sure that it wasn't about a sinus infection. It was about control. She had been annoyed because I hadn't validated her anti-vax stance in the past.\n\n\nSimilarly, I know she wanted more validation for her religious views, which she'd acquired in her 30s and which I didn't share. I'd told her that I was happy her faith made her happy, but I think she wanted me to truly share her beliefs. I'd also said that her sister's bisexuality was \"fine with me\" when she'd stated that a wedding of 2 women was \"not what God wants.\"\n\n\nI think all of those different views just threatened the way she saw the world, and how she saw herself.\n\n\nHer last texts thanked me for \"sharing my views\" re covid and it's potential to kill my Mum, then became pseudo-concerned when I didn't reply. I read the whole situation as \"I want to say whatever I want to you, but I want to still feel like a nice person, so please reply and give me that validation.\"\n\nI didn't reply to her, but I still ask myself whether the mature thing to do would have been to clearly reply and state that I didn't want to stay in contact. It's taken me until now (over a year later) to see through the pain and formulate what I might have said.\n\nWe'd been friends since the first days of high school. 20+ years. In essence we just aquired very different views from each other as adults, but I can't pretend her attitude towards my Mum, and towards the horrible journey my family had to take, wasn't devastating.\n\nLife is a bloody painful journey at times, that's for sure.",

I made her many free corsets and things over that time, because my love language was gifting and she was extremely helpful towards perfecting my craft. We met a few times, she was sweet and mostly normal. I would do little things by accident that would upset her a lot, like checking in that she was having a nice birthday when I came to visit her. Or accidentally talking over someone (I’m hearing impaired and nuerodivergent) when I got excited about a book. \n One day she told me she told me she was suicidal and disappeared for a few months. It left me sick with worry. I didn’t know if she was okay or in the hospital or what. She said I crossed her boundaries by checking in on her. \n She came back saying that she had Dissociative Identity Disorder and flipped out at me as an empathy less alter so she would not have to consider my feelings in the conversation. She laughed at me and said horrible things, told me my corsets were to control her body. \n Obviously we don’t talk anymore.\n Best Friend 2:\n They were warm and sweet online, we always had endless things to talk about. We related about so many things. They love bombed me, hard. When I went to visit them, they were cold and distant. Treated me like furniture. I cleaned their entire living room and front room (disgusting, covered in trash, it’s all I could manage), and cleaned rabbit and cat shit every day I was there. Helped tame their foster cat. They later said I was a bad house guest because I asked them to boil an egg for me.\n At one point I was so miserable on the trip (meanwhile on the verge of divorce) that I cried about being suicidal while they messaged the new person they were love bombing (a mutual corsetry friend).They sent me some of the texts by mistake, and they were making fun of me for being suicidal. The falling out was brutal.\n Friend 3:\n I made this friend online and joined her discord server. We were close besties almost right away. We watched all of Steven universe and shera together (over text), and she was very outspokenly affectionate and positive and sweet. She was dating a guy I became friends with, and they eventually broke up. Much later on, when my divorce was filed, we caught feelings and started talking about her moving down here. I was in a vulnerable place and I got swooped into the attention and distraction hard and fast. She broke up with me pretty quickly, I got way too upset, and she blocked me. Completely fair. But I started to notice that her photos were inconsistent, her hair color and length would change from ‘recent’ picture to picture, and she wouldn’t voice or video call anyone even her ex after two years. Also her photos said Facebook on them when she didn’t have a Facebook. Her ex and I put our dumb heads together and fit the pieces and caught her in some outright lies too. \n She had gone through a pattern of getting close to people and losing them when she didn’t get the attention she wanted. More people than just us. She would string them along (me and him both in many ways, her saying we’d pick up where we left off in a couple of months for example) She got confronted, refused to send a picture, and was outed as a catfish and permabanned from her own server.\n A few things have happened since then, mostly a message blaming me for being alone. But she should be. \n I’m doing fine now. Just another one gone.",

She got married later which was wonderful, very nice guy.\n\nWell one Thanksgiving I sent her a message saying, \"Happy Thanksgiving, love you\" and her husband saw this and threw a fit. They slept separately for a week and it ruined the thanksgiving that year. She blocked me everywhere but not before telling me what had happened and why she has to do this.\n\nI understand but I'm hurt. There was never a romantic relationship between us and saying, \"I love you\" was kind of a normal platonic thing between us. Oh well. I appreciate the time we had before and I love those memories. I miss my friend but we've probably changed so much since that we couldn't be friends today. Miss you Blindsey, hope you're well.",

I was going through a depressive episode at the time, and kept getting pushed into sharing personal details about my views on life, only to be criticized for them.\n\nI'd get shamed for things like being uncomfortable with learning to drive and having difficulty finding work. My friends would then talk about how much my situation was hurting them, and that they didn't want to be around me anymore. I wasn't particularly whiny, just a bit down.\n\nThe breaking point is when I was given the ultimatum to either leave my family behind (which they said was toxic), or to choose them. I was very confused as to why, so we met up to talk, and I got cut off they day after.\n\nI still have trouble sticking my neck out to make friends. I never want to go through this again.",
