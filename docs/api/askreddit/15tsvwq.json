   "message": "Because he is a spoiled, entitled, bullying ass. Or at least he was in high school.\n\nOur high school quarterback (lets call him James) was an 80's movie cliche. Good looking, rich, arrogant, did well in school (seemingly without trying). His parents had fertility issues and he was the \"miracle\" baby they unexpectedly had in their early 40s. The point is James was BEYOND SPOILED.\n\nOne of James's buddies, a linebacker on the football team (lets call him Fatass), kept asking my best friend out. She was not allowed to date and she wasn't interested in Fatass so she rejected him...repeatedly. Fatass started harassing my friend. At one point Fatass grabbed my friend's butt in the hallway. She reported him. Fatass ended up suspended from the team for two months (many other girls had reported him before). So James, the quarterback, and several teammates started harassing my friend NONSTOP to avenge Fatass. After a solid miserable quarter of this, Fatass was back on the team and most of the players backed off.\n\nBut James did not. He continued harassing my friend for another month before randomly asking her out. She refused. He said if she went on one date with him he'd leave her alone. She refused. He stepped up the harassment and she finally agreed. I don't know what he did but she agreed to a second date. Now they're attending the same university and living together. She's happy, and I'm glad for that, but it fucking sickens me that this guy got away with this shit AND got his victim to fall for him.",

   "message": "I have two close friends who luckily NOW are with great men, but both of them were with awful guys for years, I'll tell you about each of them. I'll call my first friend Lydia and my second Alexia.\n\nWe'll start with Alexia as her story is more tame. Alexia was dating this guy when I met her, which was right after she graduated high school. They were high school sweethearts, so I understand why it took her so long to leave him, but he just sucked. He never did anything too awful, like cheat on her (that we know of) or hit her or anything, but he was just a horrible boyfriend, made it clear that he didn't really want a girlfriend or have time for one, but also didn't want them to break up. The whole thing was so stupid and all of her friends, myself included, did not like him.\n\nLydia's story is a bit more intense, and also more confusing because none of us understand why she liked this guy in the first place. Her ex is a guy I'll call Martin, and he went to high school with us, but they did not date in high school. Martin has never been anything special, he's always been kind of rude, one of those guys who is edgy just to offend people, and he isn't physically attractive, or smart. He played sports, but was never that good, so I really do not understand how he always had pretty girlfriends, considering that he wasn't very nice, he was not good looking, and he had no particularly good qualities, but alas, he did.\n\nSo about a year after Lydia and I and our other mutual friend Becca graduated from high school, Lydia started dating Martin. Becca and I were surprised, for all of the reasons I just mentioned, but figured maybe he was nicer these days. He wasn't. He was still a douche whenever we were around them, and he was just gross, always spitting, chewing tobacco, saying really gross things. But Lydia was obsessed with him and threw herself into the relationship, molding her entire life around him. At a party at his parents' house one time (in which his family, who was just as shitty as him, was giving all of us underage kids booze), Lydia and Martin got really drunk and were kind of \"play fighting\", which culminated in him pushing her down the stairs. They both swore it was an accident and they weren't fighting for real, but that's when Becca and I were like what the fuck... He is worse than we thought.\n\nA year later, we hadn't seen Lydia much and finally the three of us got together for dinner. I wanted to talk to her about potentially leaving him since he was so shitty in so many ways, but at the dinner, she told us she was pregnant. In Martin's defense on this specifically, we are pretty sure to this day that she was purposely not taking her birth control properly, we don't think Martin was trying to get her pregnant. Regardless though, we knew she would be with him for a while.\n\nLooong story short, when their kid was two years old she finally left him because of his constant cheating and mental and physical abuse. They spent a year in court... And then got back together. We tried to be supportive, hoping he had changed, but a year after THAT, they broke up again and a week later he was with someone else. Like I said, NOW Lydia is married to a great guy, but we did not approve of her son's father for the many years she was with him, for very, very good reasons.",

She lived a few blocks away from us in the small city we were in, and they went to grad school together but had different majors and the same group of friends.\n\nEvery night he would end up in his room talking to her on the phone.  He'd be apologizing for something.  I don't know what for to be honest.  I also don't know why they couldn't have these conversations in person. Maybe it was me. I could have been in the way as a roommate, either way, whenever he came out of his room after those calls he always seemed beat up.  None of our mutual friends ever saw that besides me.\n\nBefore they got engaged, which happened at the end of grad school, he kind of gave me the feeling that she was pressuring him into it, and he - after several years -  was just along for the ride.  That was the closest I have ever come to telling him that he should break it off.\n\nThey are married now.  They each had their own vehicles, and his was a project car.  When it came time for them to get new, safer cars, she made him sell his to get the new car, then she gave him her old one and she took the new one.\n\nThat was the final straw for me.
