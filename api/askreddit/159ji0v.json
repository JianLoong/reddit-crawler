I was out... the next thing I remember is trying to open my eyes.  I heard the nurse frantically say, \"she's awake!\".  I remember thinking to myself, \"Oh shit, I'm awake! Am I not supposed to be awake?! What's happening?\" Then BAM! I was out again.  \nWhen I woke up (again) my mom was next to me crying because she was so relieved I was awake.  She told me they had a hard time getting me to wake up. Of course, they hadn't told her I woke up earlier, and I'm sure they were hoping I didn't remember.  I told my mom what happened and we'll, she reacted like any mother would, demanding answers. \nApparently what had happened was the doctor was supposed to be on his way so they put me out but he never showed up....and in that time I was prepped on the table waiting for him when I woke up. I guess the nurses freaked out when I woke up and decided to dose me again, and by that time, the doctor showed up and did the procedure. \n\nNow that I'm almost 40, I have a hard time believing that that actually  happened, and it's always something I think about whenever I have to get surgery or go under any anesthesia.  They probably could have been sued, but that wasn't something people really did back then. \n\nStill sucked though.",
