Anyways, Iâ€™ll start: my dad used to leave out cookies and milk and what not on for Santa Christmas night. My dad would leave us a small handwritten note for Christmas morning and one Christmas my sister noticed when I was about 5 and she was 6 that \"Santaâ€™s handwriting looks just like dadâ€™s handwriting\". I immediately knew at that moment that Santa was my parents ðŸ˜‚. Share your stories here, and Merry Christmas!!",

Magic doesnâ€™t exist, so how can this guy fly around the world in one night, dropping off presents to practically everyone. \nMy parents said I was right but not to tell my friends. Over the next few days I told everyone I encountered - adults, kids, strangers. It was game over for Santa Claus in Southern California.",
