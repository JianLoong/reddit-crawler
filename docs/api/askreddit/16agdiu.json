I know it’s so John Lennon but it would just be amazing to be free without a worry and be able to be in the company of people unbothered by each other just staying true to their own shit. \nIt’s mind boggling that people will choose friendships/ relationship based on wether we can agree on almost everything or not, or that me not having the same view as someone else would be offensive to anyone (unless it’s crime related and something that would hurt another human being of course), but I mean. Why are we rooted enough in ourselves to never take anything personally, because we had to endure some broken human being along the way.
