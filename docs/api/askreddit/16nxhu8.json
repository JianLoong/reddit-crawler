   "message": "Overwatch. I used to play it all the time, but quit when I realized that all the game ever did was piss me off and stress me out. The game itself was fun, don't get me wrong, but the community is god awful and makes it impossible to ever actually enjoy it for any extended period of time. So many people that throw matches for little to no reason, throw temper tantrums in voice chat, and other stuff like that. The last straw for me was realizing that I couldn't go even a single day without having someone intentionally throw a match in Competitive.\n\nI play games to relieve stress, not to cause it. If I'm not having fun, then there's no real point in continuing to play.",
