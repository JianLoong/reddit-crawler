FFS I've got to click through an article, and then watch some bullshit Gannett Media embedded video.\n\nI'll assume it did, otherwise the story probably wouldn't have gone too far.\n\n\nedit:  If you delve this thread, you'll be rewarded with a YT link, directly showing Ray reliving the experience.  \n\n\u0026gt;Later on, when I went down to the park, I think he realized I was trying to help him, because then whenever I would go back to the park.  He would always come up to me and acknowledge that I was there.\n\nGreat story.  Thanks for the TIL, and the person that provided the YT.  They deserve the credit for that, so scroll down if you want to see it.",
