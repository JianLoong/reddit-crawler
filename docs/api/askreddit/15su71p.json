He went on holiday to the USA and on his way back across the border the guards wanted to search his laptop which led to the discovery of child porn. He was also trying to groom his niece (daughter of the half sister).  \n\nThere wasn’t much money left from the estate at that point. He was arrested and only managed to stay out of jail on a technicality that a very expensive lawyer found. He paid mid $50k for his defense.

Sold his last remaining property, the condo, at a loss. Sold a bunch of his expensive toys at a loss. Ended up penniless (actually probably bankrupt) but not in jail. Now his life consists of living in a small rented bedroom and working as a local trucker. \n\nHe didn’t just destroy his life, he nuked it from orbit and then salted the ground.

Nowadays, they pressure me to have a child of my own while simultaneously telling me how much they never have sex or privacy, how they never agree on anything and how stressed out and miserable they are. He works 10-12 hours days, she does not work, which has started causing them fights because he wants her to go back to work when their kid is old enough to go to school. She doesn't feel like she should have to because of her efforts staying at home, but only rarely can you see the floor of their apartment in areas outside of where the baby plays.  She drinks all day while looking after their now toddler and he comes home. Generally, she passes out and he cooks dinner and puts the kid to bed. He's been getting progressively more depressed and drinking and smoking more, as has she. \n\nThey have a whole menagerie of animals, exotic and run-of-the-mill including a grown pitbull that isn't walked. I don't mean like, isn't walked enough, but I mean like she doesn't walk him at all unless a friend forces her to go for a walk with the kid and my friend doesn't walk the dog when he gets home because he tired, still has to cook and is a stubborn ass who 'doesn't feel he should have to'. The dog pisses on puppy pads on their couch in the livingroom where the child plays, as if that isn't fucking horrifying. Recently, her day drinking has escalated their fights and led to her attacking him in front of their child. Then, she passes out in bed and doesn't remember anything she did to him the next day and gaslights him, saying he's making shit up about her to ruin their relationship. He drinks more as a result, which worsens their fighting. \n\nFour years ago he used to tell me how depressed he was working an 8 hour day and going home to an empty apartment to play video games and now when he vents to me he cries about how he had no idea how lucky he was then. They've both bit off more than they can chew with their animals, with parenting and with each other. She won't stop screaming about getting married and he's suddenly realizing that he can't and won't marry her, but she'll bankrupt him if he leaves her. \n\nAll I can do is babysit, be an involved Auntie, walk the dog and support him emotionally. The more I do this though, the more she gets on me and starts making shit up about me and my 'nefarious' intentions, which makes me like her less even though I know this is likely a result of her drinking habits. Both of their drinking is wildly out of control, but I'm not even a year sober yet so I don't have a soap box to stand on. \n\nI'm trying my hardest, because I'm the oldest child of an abusive home and it fucks me up all kinds of ways that his kid has to see and live all of this. Even when I don't agree with either of them, I'm always there because I love that kid. \n\nBut maaaan, I'd be fucking lying if I said I didn't want to grab him by his shirt some days when he's crying to me about this whole mess and snarl, \"*You were the only one who didn't think this was a bad idea. This is all on you.*\" because he knows that. \n\nLike, we all know how this is going to play out but for whatever reason, he thinks it'll be different for him. \n\nSo, we march on.",

A penny stock.\n\nIt became a \"meme\" stock around the Gamestop era, his holdings went from about $50k to $7 million in a few weeks.  He knew the valuations were complete bullshit, but refused to sell.  He said $10 million was his \"fuck you\" money number and only when it hit that, would he sell.  I  begged him to sell because it was obvious it was a short term phenomenon and he had made a lot of bad bets in his life.\n\nThe company lost about 99% of its value from its high.  He did get out about $500k, taxes got about 30% of it.  But watch almost all of it evaporate.\n\nHe's absolutely miserable at his new job.  He could have retired at a young age.\n\nStill can't believe he did it, like throwing away a lottery ticket.",

It was such a weird thing since he died very peacefully and without him even knowing which is what he would've wanted, but his death was caused by his fear of death, so it was literally a self fulfilling prophecy. Man destroyed his happiness due to a fear that he literally caused to come true.

   "message": "My parents separated earlier this year. It was 100% my dad's fault due to being an abusive textbook narcissist. Mum put their house up for sale and he had 2 months to sort out his move. \n\nHe claimed to have nothing, no support and nowhere to go. My husband and I took pity on him, and despite having a newborn and both working, helped him pack, sell off the extra furniture to get him some cash and I found him a secure place to buy in his budget. \n\nHe turned around and said he didn't want to move into the type of place I found (an over 50s village, he's 73) because he \"wouldn't be able to take chicks back there to fuck\". He then refused to leave the property and said the cops would have to shoot him to get him out of the house. When I put pressure on him (because otherwise the sale would have fallen over and they would have been sued) he threatened suicide (which he does absolutely everytime something isn't going his way) and to burn the house down repeatedly, including in front of my 7 year old kid. \n\nEventually he does comply and we move him, into the granny flat of a woman he met playing pokies and who is apparently \"a millionaire from a famous family\" (I call bullshit, but he clearly thinks he's found someone new to mooch off.) They have been at the pokies every day for months now - his money won't last long at this rate.\n\nThen, I find out that through all this, all the stress and bullshit he put me through when I should have been in a happy new baby cocoon, he actually had had an offer from a long-time friend to move in with him and his wife, and that they had a whole team of people willing to help him with his move. Considering that he ghosted them after they made that offer though, they have since decided to discontinue the friendship since he's shown he didn't value it or them. Guess what - my husband and I are also done with him. I was the last kid that spoke to him. \n\nSo, he went from married with a family, to living in insecure housing, hurtling towards poverty and homelessness, having burned every bridge he had. All because he is too narcissistic to accept that he is less than perfect and that he is ultimately responsible for his own life. \n\n(That rant felt good :))",

He wanted to stick to the plan, live fairly modestly now, albeit in a beautiful house and taking a nice holiday every year, and then living it up later and still be able to set the kids up.\n\nShe spent hours complaining to my wife about how \"boring\" this plan was and she couldn't understand why she can't just buy a Porsche right now and just live for today rather than have some vague \"future\" fun. Her eventual solution was to live out her Sons of Anarchy fantasy and start banging the mongols gang member she met at school drop off. That lasted all of about a month before her husband found out, he kicked her out of the house, she tried to get the biker to threaten him, the biker instead decided to drop her like a hot potato, Husband went for full custody with evidence she had been banging a known criminal and drug dealer. Daughters were old enough to place 100% blame on her.\n\n Last I heard she was being kicked out of her rental and facing homelessness because she has never held a job for more than a month in her life and has always found dudes to pick up the Tab, but now as a single mother pushing 40 that option is off the table. \n\nShe's my wifes ex-friend because her daughters and ours are close friends and I always got along with her husband much more than I ever liked her, so her husband won us in the divorce as well.",

I told him if he gets the gig he can figure out the move over there and he’ll be making enough to move his girlfriend and her two kids. I said that of course it’ll be a difficult move but he has to follow his dreams and passions.\n\nWell, they made him an offer above what he asked for. I remember the day he got the news, he called me crying and I cried too cause I was so fucking happy for him. He deserved it and he is a good person. His girlfriend was absolutely not ok with it, and she said he only supported him when he applied cause she didn’t expect him to get an offer. \n\nShe threatened to break up with him, and even accused him of “abandoning his children” and “forcing the children to be raised without a father” even though they weren’t his children, they had only been dating a year, and her kids were 8 and 12 at the time. He finally gave in and turned down the offer. I was so disappointed and I was upset with her.\n\nShe called some time later and yelled at me for getting his hopes up even though I supposedly knew they would be problem with her. She also accused me of trying to get him to break up with her. After that, he and I hung out less and less till finally communication stopped all together. About a year later he sent me a message saying that he hated me for putting him in that dilemma. That honestly hurt the most.\n\nThat was about twenty years ago. He’s still at the same data entry company, and he got his first promotion! He’s now a senior software engineer after being stuck with the junior title for 20 god damn years.\n\nAnyway, the company he wanted to work for was Boston Dynamics.",
