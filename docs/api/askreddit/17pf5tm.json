   "message": "Wedding cakes for sure. I work weddings; I've been to something like 150 of them so far, and have tried the cake at literally all of them. The vast majority of them are simply awful. I have only actually enjoyed eating the cake twice the entire time I've worked this job: once with some sort of specialty Korean cake, and one that was made by the Bride's mom. And what's worse is that these cakes cost an exorbitant amount of money! We're talking like $500 3-tier art pieces that look nice, but taste like a sponge with shaving cream on it. Just not something I can get behind. So, with that being said, word to the wise: don't buy a crazy-expensive wedding cake, I promise you it is not that good.\r  \n\r  \nUpdate: If any of you guys are planning a wedding soon or are getting married or whatever, feel free to shoot me a message or something! I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have, I'm pretty knowledgeable about the whole thing, really. Maybe I'll do an AMA or something?",
