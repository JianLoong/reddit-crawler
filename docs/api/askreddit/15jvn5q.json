Another one she played was Allison who was a Canadian soccer mom type of character. They were VERY different. They talked different, they acted different, they dressed different but they were clones so they had the same face. \n\nThere was a scene where Sarah, the British one, had to pretend to be Allison, the Canadian one. While doing it the British accent slips through in the same spots a lot of British actors have hard times with where they don't quite sound fully American(or Canadian in this instance). It made it way more realistic. Also, Tatiana maslany isn't British. She is Canadian. She is a Canadian pretending to be a British person pretending to be a Canadian and letting the British accent slip through just a bit. not exactly one line but a whole scene that was elevated because of her\n\nSome of the best acting I've seen on TV came from her in that show.

In pretty much any other actor's hands, it would have been among the most eyerolling scenes imaginable.

And it's perfect for the movie, because it gives this sort of widening, blooming feel of \"you haven't been watching a movie about a man and his corn field, you're watching a movie about something much more universal and relatable than that, you just didn't know it until now.\" And then the final scene of the movie happens and it just warmly fills every void you didn't even know needed filling.",

Him and the Pope. Sexual orientation. The whole works, right? \nBut I bet you can’t tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. \nYou’ve never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. \nSeen that. \nIf I ask you about women, you’d probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. \nYou may have even been laid a few times. \nBut you can’t tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. \nYou’re a tough kid. \nIf I ask you about war, you’d probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? \n“Once more into the breach, dear friends.” \nBut you’ve never been near one. You’ve never held your best friend’s head in your lap and watch him gasp his last breath, looking to you for help. \nIf I ask you about love, you’d probably quote me a sonnet. \nBut you’ve never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. \nKnown someone who can level you with her eyes. \nFeeling like God put an angel on earth just for you. \nWho could rescue you from the depths of Hell. And you wouldn’t know what it’s like to be her angel. \nTo have that love for her be there forever. Through anything. Through cancer. \nAnd you wouldn’t know about sleeping, sitting up in a hospital room for two months, holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms visiting hours don’t apply to you. \nYou don’t know about real loss. Because that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. \nI doubt you’ve ever dared to love anybody that much. \nI look at you, I don’t see an intelligent, confident man. \nI see a cocky, scared-shitless kid. \nBut you’re a genius, Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you.\nBut you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine, you ripped my fucking life apart. \nYou’re an orphan, right? \nDo you think I’d know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you? \nPersonally, I don’t give a shit about all that, because you know what? I can’t learn anything from you that I can’t read in some fucking book. Unless you want to talk about you. Who you are. And I’m fascinated. I’m in. But you don’t want to do that, do you, sport? \nYou’re terrified of what you might say. \nYour move, chief",
