She was so angry we didn’t celebrate my birthday. She did eventually gift me soon before dinner some electronic toy she bought the very same day, but she did so with such spite and hatred from my point of view…\n\nShe doesn’t even remember today.",

This was for normal kids stuff like saying I hated my mom because I was mad at her.",
