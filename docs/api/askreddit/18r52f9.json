   "message": "The mental health and education of American kids would be far, far better.  I worked in schools during the pandemic, and so I watched as the fragile systems we had in place were taken away.\n\nNo Child Left Behind and the factory education model meant that nobody wanted to hold back the kids who didn't learn for a couple years.  In my area, more kids regressed than progressed their education over the first years of the pandemic, but got put ahead by multiple grades anyways.  Different kids got affected different amounts (usually based on parental involvement), so now teachers are in a predicament where there's literally not a lesson that's on-level for the majority of their class.  This causes educational disparities to widen, which makes the problem even worse.\n\nMeanwhile, schools in America were unable to provide the wide variety of services that they've been forced to provide.  For many kids, school was where they socialized, school was where they accessed mental healthcare, their clothes came from school, and it was where they went to get away from their abusive families.  Now kids are years behind on socialization while having mental health difficulties piled onto the already difficult process of growing up.  If they're still going to school, they have to spend hours per day bored while their teacher gives lessons not at their level (see previous paragraph), and the kids who are too behind on the fundamentals to grasp the lessons are just stuck in an activity all day that tells them, \"you're stupid\".  All this leads to major behavior issues and an overwhelming of America's mental health system, which then makes everything else harder, which makes the problem even worse.\n\nSo now America's youth are stuck in multiple snowballing problems that can't be fixed without multiple major institutional changes that lack the political will to be implemented.",
