I used to feed and watch a pregnant stray dog in area. Didn't see her for some days, thought she might have given birth in other street and forgot about it. \nOn this particular day, I lost all my strength and didn't want to exist anymore,so I made plans for that night.  Just around noon ,I see her walking in park with small pups behind her . Most people where I'm from aren't kind to street animals, and  feeding pregnant dog was a very difficult task , as most  neighbours will fight  about it and there's useless society WhatsApp groups creating more pressure on animal feeders and chairperson of our society that did politics on this issue as well !!. \nAfter seeing pups in park all I could do was hold my head in my hands and just fight with God for bringing more lives in such state . I kept on asking God ,\"Whose going to feed them ? Whose going to care for them ??\" Please don't bring more lives in such state.... \nThis was 4 \u0026amp; half years ago. Mama dog died 3 months after giving birth. Her 2 girls and a son are still going strong ..Not a day when they haven't eaten. \nI feed them , medicate them,  care for them. I'm their person. They're my people. \nBonus : My boy as a leggy lady friend, who left her pack to be here. Living was better heree, and she's a part of our pack. \nI do not think the good Lord had any worries about the pups care.
