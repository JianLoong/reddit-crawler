 "selftext": "Hi y’all, I’m sorry for posting here. I genuinely need you guys’ opinion and will accept whatever verdict you give me. \n\nI’m pregnant. I decided I was going to give the baby up for adoption quite soon after finding out, due to many reasons (among them my age and stuff). \n\nMy family knows. The father doesn’t though, and I don’t want to tell him. He wasn’t a kind person when we were dating. (I don’t wanna get into it too much.) We were sort of together and it went bad FAST. I ended up blocking him and cutting off contact, which was a struggle in itself. \n\nI feel like if I tell him, he’ll use it in a way to keep me close. But maybe I’m being too selfish…? I don’t know. I figured if I told everyone that I didn’t know who the father is, I’d be able to do it without his permission. Maybe? But idk. \n\nSorry for this. \n\nAITA for not telling him?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone for replying. I’m really grateful, even if I’m the AH. Can I just ask not to send chats? \n\nAlso, I do know I need to stay away from him myself. But I don’t know if he’s like this with others, or maybe he’d be a good father. That’s why I feel conflicted. Just because I brought that out in him, doesn’t mean others will, I guess. He’s not a horrible person. ",

   "message": "You need a lawyer. \n\nFor an adoption, you’re going to be asked who the father is, because a child can’t be given up for adoption without both biological parents signing off. What specifically are they going to ask you in order to try to find the father? (And the adoption agency will want to find him, because not trying his consent is grounds to reverse the adoption and rip the child from their adoptive family.) Are there publication requirements? Will you be asked to name everyone it possibly could be? Will they ask no follow up questions and risk a legal battle over your child later, and if so, who has to pay for that? \n\nYou also need to know whether there are ramifications for you if you lie and say you don’t know: can you get in trouble, and if so, what kind of trouble? And you need to know what happens if he finds out you’re pregnant before the adoption goes through, so you can make plans if he blocks the adoption. \n\nAnd finally, you need to know what happens if he finds out after the adoption, what rights he would have to reverse the adoption, what would happen next if he succeeded and the baby was taken from the adoptive parents and given to him, and whether anything would happen to you for keeping it from him. \n\nYou may also have other options as a victim of physical abuse—and I know you prefer not to call it that, but that’s what it was—that you’re not aware of, that might be better than what you’re planning to do now. \n\nThe answers to these questions vary among jurisdictions, so you really need to talk to a lawyer now to find out all possible outcomes.",

Both parents have the right to fight for custody if they want it. And to adopt, you need to sever the legal ties of both birth parents. Adoption agencies and adoptive parents absolutely do not want to be brought to court a few months or years after an adoption has taken place because it turns out the birth father was never told and now he wants to fight for his legal rights. This destroys families.\n\nYou 100% need to talk to people in your state/county that know how to navigate this right now and tell you what is legally required to adopt out a child.
