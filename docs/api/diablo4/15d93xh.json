   "message": "Decided to do NM100 as my last dungeon to level to 100, after hearing how easy they were. Apparently doing this tired at 1AM was a bad idea, and the quillrat poison can literally one shot you across the map. My fault for not scrolling after the elixir popped, but I was trying to figure out why the protection bubble didn't pop and then was dead.\n\nI'm not even sure why HC is in this game, it's literally pointless with the cheat death elixir. You proc and scroll. I see these big name HC streamer talk about how they hate cheat death but they all use it. And then they're like \"Well I'm going this run without proccing cheat dead\" and then somehow they all end up proccing cheat death before 100.",
