The street was on a hill and my car was parked on the downhill side of traffic a couple hundred feet from a blind curve in the road. I checked for cars and got out of the driver's side of the car, being careful not to step too far in the street. There were no cars going by at the time. \n\nSuddenly, a voice inside my head shouted \"FREEZE!!! DON'T MOVE!!!\" I instinctually froze and pressed myself up against my car even though I had no idea why. Out of nowhere a large city bus came barreling around the curve going at least 60mph and missed hitting me by just a couple inches. I can still feel the wind from the bus on the back of my neck at it blew past me. If I had taken just half a step back to lock my car door, I would have been flattened and that would have been it. \n\nEven worse, my future husband was with me and would have witnessed it all.
