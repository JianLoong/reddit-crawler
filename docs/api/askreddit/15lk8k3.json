   "message": "I don't own a gun because of a time I had a home intruder.  That sounds counter-intuitive but the circumstances were a little complicated.  My mom was sick in bed with chemo when a gigantic man ran in through the front door screaming and yelling in a rage.  I didn't have a gun available to me easily at the time, so I grabbed a Japanese short sword I was given for completing a kendo program as a teen.  I reached the hallway at the same time he reached the door to her room.  He was near a foot taller than me, and I am 6', and clearly weighed 300+ pounds.  \n\n\nI was intimidated to run up to such a huge man and start hacking with a blade, not something I ever imagined myself doing.  My adrenaline was peaking and I was about to charge, but I stopped first and shouted, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE, in the meanest voice I have ever used.  The man turned and looked at me with eyes a toddler gives you when you shout at them for being naughty.  I immediately realized that I was dealing with a mentally disabled person, and that he meant no harm.  He was a severely autistic man who lived with the family that had just moved in across the street.  I was about 25, and had just moved back home a few days before to help take care of my Mom, and had never seen him before.  He was scared by me shouting at him, and ran home crying across the street.  \n\n\nI called the Sheriff.  They tried to blow it off and say he didn't know any better, I made it clear I didn't want him charged I wanted his family to know how dangerous this was.  I told the Deputy that I know for fact the houses on both sides are gun owners who would have shot him in that circumstance.  I then told him about my encounter and how I was ready to use lethal force.  This was in a state with castle doctrine so lethal force would have been 100% legally justified in that situation.  The Deputy went white when he realized this was nearly a fatality.  He went back to talk to the man's family.  \n\n\nThis was the last time I ever saw him, the family moved not long after.   I didn't feel too bad about my part in the situation, I responded the best I could in the moment.  I also realized that I am a person who is hyper defensive of my family.  Looking back I am 100% confident I would have fired instead of yelling if I had a gun in my hand, and a man who was no true threat would have died.  I don't want to kill someone unless there is no other choice, but with a gun in my hand I might not always see all the possible outcomes of a situation.  Maybe a day will come when I regret this choice, but so far it has not.  I do enjoy target shooting with other people's guns though.",
