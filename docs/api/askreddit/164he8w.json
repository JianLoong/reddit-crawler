   "message": "I‚Äôve heard that in some parts of Louisiana, the people are so poor it‚Äôs like their living in a 3rd world country. \n\nThere‚Äôs an interesting story about a former Minor League Baseball player named Toe Nash, who grew up in one of these parts of Louisiana. More specifically, Sorrento Louisiana. \n\nThe guy didn‚Äôt have a birth certificate, no social security number, and had no proof on record that he actually existed. Dropped out in 8th Grade, and was only discovered when a MLB scout traveled to Sorrento and watched him play baseball in a makeshift corn field. \n\n[Baseball Doesn‚Äôt Exist](https://youtu.be/6QTTDLWOouw?si=mgPMQcGzR97fMpSJ) has a good video on this guy. Go check it out if you want a better insight into what life is like in those parts of Louisiana.",

Sometimes if you're lucky you'll find puke stains on the side walk that's either fresh or dried out. The bus has homeless, the malls have homeless, and starbucks has homeless people. Crazy enough that there's POS kids that have been doing run and grabs at every store now and then there was the topgana mall getting robbed by nothing but 50+ kids in one day. Police doesn't do anything, security cannot do anything, so it's an endless cycle. Oh and traffic is horrible, even as a pedestrain the drivers are willing to run you over because they're texting or they got important things to deal with so they might as well run you over. And i'm not in the inner city, i'm right by the beaches and it's that bad.",
