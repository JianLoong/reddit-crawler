Being quiet and being next to each other can sometimes be better \n\nDistance is a critical part of a rs\n\nTrust is also very important\n\nCommunication can only be key if both are respective of one another and if it’s done right, saying things to your partner that need to be said or need to get out of your chest isn’t only communication",

Find someone that you want to spend the entire day with every day. Someone that you don’t get sick of. And that doesn’t get sick of you. I want to desire them by lunch the next day and for them to be manically texting me before I get to my desk about what we will do that night when the day is finally over and we can spend time together again. \n\nIf it’s not that, then I don’t want it.",
