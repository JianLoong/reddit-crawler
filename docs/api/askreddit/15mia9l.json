They just want to stay home and watch TV or do the same things over and over. When I suggest new things, they shoot down every suggestion. They stop asking me about my life or my interests or even my day. If I try to bring something up, they just kill the conversation or change the topic.  Then they start picking on me - my looks, my habits, really anything and everything. \n\nPretty soon, the *only* acceptable conversation topics are how was their day, what to eat for dinner..

I told him it was my birthday and was hoping we could just celebrate me and him (we NEVER had date nights. His friends were always involved). I guess I was asking for too much and broke up with me over text that same day. \n\nWent over his place the next day to pick up some of my things. He gave me a fist bump, told me to have a good life, and blocked me on all social media. Don‚Äôt know why, but I never once begged him back or said anything mean. \n\nHis BIL told him many times how he made a big mistake letting me go. I put up with a lot of shit other girls wouldn‚Äôt have, and realized that after we had broken up. \n\nDating is exhausting.",

   "message": "He ate all my edibles in one go while I was in the shower. AFTER I told him to eat only ONE because I made them very strong, one for him and one for me. \n\nThen he turned around and told me he didn't remember me telling him that OR remember eating both edibles. FIFTEEN FUCKING MINUTES after I said those things! 15 minutes after eating them, he didn't remember it?\n\nBullshit. I will never ever be convinced he didn't remember that. He ate both of those edibles because he WANTED them both. \n\nIt was then that I realized he was out of control. He couldn't stay out of rehab, was constantly doing shit that would (if caught) get him thrown in jail (again), was probably shitfaced drunk and hiding it. Alcohol was something I would not tolerate from him because he has a severe problem with it, has drank himself into a literal near-death coma more than once and was lying to everyone about not drinking. In an out of rehab like a washed up actor but minus the fame and money. \n\nOf course after taking almost a full gram of THC that night, he got really stupid, clumsy and acted like a complete asshole once it kicked in. Thankfully he passed out about an hour and a half after he ate them both. \n\nI babysat him until it wore off, just to make sure he didn't stumble across the street to the liquor store and drink himself to death or do some other stupid thing and when I could finally shout him awake at 8 am I packed up his stuff and dropped him at his place. After totally unloaded on him and told him we were done. \n\nI'd google him to see if he's still alive or not but he's got a really common full name so I doubt I'd find anything. \n\nDude needs some heavy duty Dr. Phil tier grippy sock hospitalization but he will never get it and probably wouldn't get sober even if he did. \n\nI feel pity for him but I can't save him.",

They don't usually realize how much I care about them.\n\nMy last relationship probably I did because everything I did to \"protect myself\" (My ego and emotions), and she started hating me. She eventually became indifferent. \n\nAnd then she started coming back after the break up, promise me sweet nothings and then I'd find out that when I was around she was banging a few other guys.\n\nAnd then I'd leave, and then she'd come back and I'd fall for it again.\n\nIt made me even more psycho up to the point I ended up in jail and paying fines.\n\nAnd then I moved on. I'd stop believing in love as the concept I thought it was. \n\nAnd now here I am, dating a girl and trying to break myself free from these everlasting thoughts. \n\nShe could be cheating, she could not be. I probably won't ever know until I do or she leaves. But I'm doing my best to be the best man, leader, and lover I can be right now.\n\nEdit: if it tells you anything about my mind state right now, I tried to proofread this comment and realized a lot of it was a bit jumbled.",
