I remember thinking she was kinda rude and really annoying as a kid, but I recently rewatched it after having not seen in more than 15 years and wow, she’s a terrible person. \n\nEspecially in the last episodes where she’s so jealous of Darren, that she keeps trying to ruin the relationship, and they have the same argument over and over. At least Miranda was straight up with Ginger about not liking her, Dodie was either fake the whole time, or just incredibly selfish.",
