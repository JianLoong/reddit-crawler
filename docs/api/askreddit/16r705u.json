   "message": "When they are given an analogy, and instead of responding to the abstract comparison being made, they instead argue directly against the metaphor.\n\nHere's an analogy to help describe the big bang and how it happened everywhere and wasn't centralized.\n\n\u0026gt;A useful analogy is a loaf of raisin bread rising as it bakes. Like space, the dough expands as it rises. Like galaxies, the raisins grow further and further apart as the dough expands, and the distance they move apart is proportional to their initial separation.  \n\u0026gt;  \n\u0026gt;[https://www.popscicoll.org/big-bang/the-expansion-of-the-universe.html](https://www.popscicoll.org/big-bang/the-expansion-of-the-universe.html)\n\nResponse 1: And sometimes when baking the bread goes flat, and I don't think their theory accounts for that at all so I don't understand how it could be right\n\nResponse 2: You're telling me that there was bread before the universe began. Bread is a human invention, did you even think that through?\n\nResponse 3: If our galaxy is like a raisin then that doesn't make a lot of sense because our galaxy is made of many stars, and a raisin is made of a single raisin\n\nResponse 4: I'm not sure where cooking comes into this. We're talking about the universe, not Gordon Ramsey\n\nResponse 5: Listen, I've baked raisin bread many times, and I can certainly tell you that it did not feel like I was making the universe\n\nResponse 6: Our universe did not start as bread, it was more fundamental materials\n\nIf someone is just being an ass and pretending to not understand the metaphor then that's less dumb, but a lot of people seem to think that they understood your point and are showing you an obvious flaw in it.",
