They sound great on paper.\n\nMeanwhile, everyone I’ve ever talked to in person who has used those apps (whether as a therapist or a client) has had an awful experience.\n\nEDIT: to address some of the comments, I don't think app-based therapy is inherently bad or anything, and I definitely understand the benefits in terms of expanding access for people who might not otherwise have access to \"traditional\" therapy for one reason or another. The horror stories I've heard generally have more to do with privacy issues, unqualified therapists giving bad/dangerous advice, pay/hours, things like that.",
