This dormitory was a mixed type, girls and boys lived in one multi-story building, but in separate rooms, each with 4 people. I was just starting to date a hot goth pervert chick then, we lost our head about each other. But since both she and I had three other people living in our rooms besides us, we didn't had a lot of opportunity to stay intimate. \n\nAt that time I was playing in a band, my drummer rented two rooms in a bunker at the outskirts of the city - that was our studio. I shared the studio fee with the other members of the band equally. Drummer arranged and decorated the place, so it was very cozy there.  He worked here, and our music equipment was set up in a separate room. There was a comfortable sofa in his workplace. \n\nIt was a violently freezing December, so a street bang wasn't an option (and seriously, who would want to have first sex with a potential permanent partner on the street?). I asked the drummer for a keys to the studio for one day, citing \"personal issues\".  My girlfriend and I made mulled wine, took some fruit, scented candles and chocolate and went to the studio in the evening.\nAnd oh God, it was a beautiful night. We turned on the new album Cigarettes After Sex - Cry, drank some wine to warm up.\nAfter a hot night, we cleaned everything without a trace, took the trash out with us, and went back to the hostel at five in the morning.\n\nI told the drummer about this situation while being caught by the euphoria after our concert a few months later. He was angry at me - and I understand why. After all, \"personal issues\" is a rather puny interpretation of what was essentially \"I need a room for a bang\". \nSo this situation, plus my low level of mastery of my instrument plus the outbreak of covid was the reason why I was kicked out of the group. \nI'm feel sorry about my unclearness with the drummer, but to be honest, he wasn't clear with me about a lot of things about the band either. \nSo that night was worth it, I guess.\n\nSeveral years have passed since this situation. I had a lot of interesting adventures and travels with that girl, but we broke up a year and a half ago. We weren't able to cope with each other's depressions, and made some mess with our lives. She went through the therapy after the breakup and is doing better now. I suffered from loneliness for a long time and made some music here and there. The drummer asked me to come back to the band, we talked a lot about our past and plans and now we are best friends. We preparing new material, hanging out here and there.\n\nWhat conclusions can be drawn? Who knows. Life is a funny and exciting thing, enjoy it and stay sincere with your friends and with yourself",
