   "message": "Well, I guess I'm proudly addicted to replaying movie scenes on youtube that randomly pop into my head, and then reading all the comments and liking everyone's reaction, especially if they made me laugh or pointed out something I didn't realize. I basically live vicariously through others, because no one I know IRL wants to analyze how great a movie scene is, with me for an hour. Take for example, Terminator 2. Oh man, that scene when John asked the machine \"who sent you?\", and he slowly turns his head to say \"You did...35 years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time\". The subtle details, the perfectly inserted, serious and yet dystopian-feeling, soundtrack. I get chills no matter how many times I watch that scene. I'm gonna end this comment now, or else I'll keep talking..\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/fXfJlET4PSI?si=0jNqlL-E_p_mGeGM",
