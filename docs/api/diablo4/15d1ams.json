 "selftext": "Having enemies 5 levels beneath you was not the right solution.\n\nIt does a disservice to and goes directly against exploring your beautiful open world.\n\nIt makes tree of whispers laughably easy without any real challenge and turns them into a simple task of clicking a few buttons rather than any sort of skill involved in having to dodge attacks or use the full arsenal at your disposal.\n\nAnd it destroys any meaningful xp gains from just wandering around and discovering new places.\n\nPlease revert these changes and I'd even argue go a step further by having tree of whispers tasks, when active, scale similarly to helltides by being a few levels higher than the player.\n\nThanks for listening.l",
