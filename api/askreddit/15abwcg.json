   "message": "Was definitely an interesting hearing. Some wild statements made by both the witnesses (tic tac description, description of \"non-human intelligence\", football field size crafts, etc) and congress members (video of large orbs in formation).\n\nIf there is truth to these statements, hopefully the public will eventually get to see the hard evidence. \n\nAlso hard to discount that this is one of the few topics both republicans and democrats seem to agree with each other on. Not sure if that lends credibility to the topic, but points to them knowing more from closed door cessions that the public has seen. This is further corroborated by the multiple comments of over classification and the need to declassify at least old material",

   "message": "It's difficult to say because we really don't know anything yet. Some of Grusch's claims seem reasonable (government not disclosing details of UFO encounters) while others seem downright bonkers (retrieval and reverse engineering of nonhuman spacecraft.)\n\nI could believe that there have been sightings of drones or vessels of unknown origin, but it's much harder to believe that such vessels are known or proven to be of otherworldly origin or that they move with no propulsion system. The latter would break the laws of physics, and an alien spacecraft would still be subject to the laws of physics.  \n\nSo while I think it's absolutely possible, even probable, that there have been and still are experimental aircraft both from within and outside of the USA that have been uncovered, I would need convincing evidence to entertain the idea that they could be from another planet.  \n\nI find it difficult to believe that an extraterrestrial race would be present on or around earth without publicly making themselves known, and it's not exactly the sort of thing that would be easy to hide either.  \n\nGrusch's claims fall apart quickly when examined closely. No one questioned has any evidence to support any of these claims, and even Grusch himself admitted he has never seen any of these things himself, yet he nevertheless insists that aliens and alien spacecraft must both necessarily be real. Basically he's using circular logic; the fact that there is no evidence proves there's a coverup, which proves the aliens are real. It's actually pretty sad when you break it down.  \n\nI have no doubt that people have seen UFOs/UAPs. I do not believe there is any evidence to support claims that these unidentified \"things\" are alien in nature. I think it's a case of a handful of individuals who want to believe looking for an excuse to believe.",
