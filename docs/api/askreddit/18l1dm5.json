You could not get away from her, for even a second. She was on TikTok, she was on the For You pages, people were copying her song and turning it into a horrible trend that lasted for what seemed like a lifetime, she was all over Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, she was in the news, doing award shows. You just could not get away from the woman, no matter how hard you tried.\n\nThat, and I just really don't like that social media has tried so so very hard to push this narrative that she's some brilliant, inspiring singer that girls should look up to, when in actual fact, she seems like a genuinely horrible human being.\n\nI don't like her, I don't like her attitude, I don't like her music, I don't like that social media has tried to constantly push her as some amazing person when she's clearly just not.",
