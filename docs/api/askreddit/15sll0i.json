Walmart doesn't have any kind of covering, so when you park you are leaving your car to literally bake in the sun.  Sometimes the dashboard is soft because it's partially melted.  It's fucking MISERABLE outside.  If I have been in the store long enough for that to matter, then that means I've got a lot of groceries to load up.  That's even less fun.  I also have a 5 year old who is sitting in said hot car.  The AC is on, but it's not really doing shit until I get the car moving and there is air flow into the radiator.  Even then, I need to get that kid home ASAP.  I can't like, pre-cool the car at all.\n\nIf the cart return area is nearby, I'll return it, but sometimes I have to park so far from one that I just don't give a fuck, I put it in a safe spot, kicks the wheels so it won't wander in a breeze, and go on about my day.\n\nTL;DR, Florida is stupid hot and I don't want my 5 year old to get a heat stroke.",
