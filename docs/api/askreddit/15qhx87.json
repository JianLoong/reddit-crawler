   "message": "I have been a PCP for nearly 10 years and went to see a dermatologist because I thought I was developing psoriasis. I had a scaly-looking rash on my knees, elbows, and tailbone. There was some starting to show up on my scalp as well. \n\nShe very quickly told me it looked like a Celiac rash. I was immediately skeptical as I had zero gastrointestinal symptoms and the rash had been present for over a year. My recent labs also looked perfect. \n\nShe was 100% right. The Celiac panel lit up like a Christmas tree and a gut biopsy confirmed it. \n\nIt is very nice to get an outside perspective.",

I don't know if they can write their own prescriptions, but I imagine if they couldn't and needed to they'd just approach a colleague and ask them to do it.\n\nThey can't write medical certificates for their loved ones though.

A few when heard I was studying medicine asked about what year I was in and treated me as a colleague. Most doctors (basically all the lazy bums) don‚Äôt take it particularly well especially if you try to point out that what they are saying is actually wrong. \nI can say with certainty that at least 50% of the time doctors that visited me where either wrong about stuff or using informations and methods that were outdated, I sadly lost much of my respect for the profession and for mild things just treat myself if possible, no use to being told it‚Äôs just influenza if I have an advanced pharyngeal infection or that‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when fainting of dehydration after severe and sustained vomiting",
