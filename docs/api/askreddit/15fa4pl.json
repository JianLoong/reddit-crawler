Thanks!  \n\n\nSo, a lot of people asking about lawsuits. Unfortunately, that was not an option. This was a low-income state-sponsored thing that the dentists volunteered for, and part of getting them to volunteer was a no-liability thing. Plus at the time I kind of figured I'd probably explained which tooth wrong rather than him just pulling the wrong one. I'm guessing I probably could have held the state liable, but at the time I was much younger and not very savvy, so I never pursued it.  \n\n\nI've noted a couple of people say that kidney stones are more painful than abscessed teeth. Now I've had kidney stones, and I'm guessing you didn't let me finish:P Also, abscessed teeth can vary in pain intensity, as can kidney stones.  \n\n\nAnyways, I can't keep up with all the replies to save my life, but I appreciate the discussion from everyone!",

   "message": "Testicular torsion. I was seventeen and didn't know what it was (thought it might be blue balls?) so waited until it was the size of a grapefruit and in excruciating pain and had mom take me to the ER.\n\nHalf my testicle was dead but I got a Demerol drip and all was good after that, but oh boy, that pain was significantly worse than the kidney stones.\n\nEdit.  Wow, didn‚Äôt realize there were so many members of the Twisted Nut Club!  Like I said, mine happened at 17 and wasn‚Äôt addressed until day three.  At that point I couldnt sit down or drive due to the MASSIVE NUT that WS preventing me from closing my legs. \n\nAnyhow much of the tissue (organ?) was not savable so the surgeon had to remove a fair amount.   Now I‚Äôve got some testicle left and also a whole bunch of scar tissue.  It‚Äôs gross and I had low sperm count for awhile, but now I‚Äôve got two kids so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nGood thing is when they opened me up the doc said he‚Äôd ‚Äúlasso‚Äù the other testicle (my right one in this case) to the side so it wouldnt face the same fate as the dead left nut. \n\nBut guess what? Two years later I woke up one morning and felt a familiar pain. I was boarding a plane that morning but I knew WTF was going on so I called ahead and had it operated on later that day.  I probably shoulda sued the original surgeon for testicular negligence but I never pursued it.  Meh.  \n\nYears later, (about 10 years ago now) my wife and I headed down the coast so I could race a 50k in SLO. Woke up w what I thought were butterflies and went thru the whole process.  Ended up barfing and passing out and my wife drove me (gingerly but still painfully!) to the ER where they looked at me and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll he‚Äôs either in labor or he has a kidney stone.‚Äù  Yep, a hefty 3mm stone lodged in my ureter. That sh‚Äôt was painful but still nothing comparedto the twisted nut.\n\nEdit 2 Typis",
