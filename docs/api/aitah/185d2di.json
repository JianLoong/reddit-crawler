 "selftext": "Everyone in the family was going to our aunt's house for Thanksgiving. She lives about 8 hours away from me, my parents, and my 3 siblings. So we had a long road trip. My brother Kyle and I were going to go together in my car.\n\n Our sister, Rachel, wanted to go with us in my car. The reason being that our parents car is not as nice. It's a small car so it's pretty cramped. It's also a little messy because of our brother, Matty. So there are some stains and smells. Rachel is currently pregnant and she thought she would not be comfortable in a cramped car for that long. She also thought the smells in that car would make her nauseous.\n\nKyle and I didn't like the idea because she has to stop to pee so much and we wanted to keep it down to one stop to get there as fast as possible. The comfort of the car and smells aside it made for since to us for Rachel to go with our parents since Matty can't stay in the car for long durations. So they would be making lot's of stops anyway. \n\nFurthermore Kyle and I do not have the best relationship with Rachel. We just don't get along or have much in common. It's only gotten worse with the outbursts she has fairly often now that she's pregnant. It seems like every little thing sets her off. So an 8 hour (likely longer due to all the pee breaks) car ride wasn't appealing to any of us. \n\nIn the end she decided not to go and keeps bitching at us for her being alone on Thanksgiving. It was her choice though and she had other options.\n\n\u0026amp;#x200B;",
