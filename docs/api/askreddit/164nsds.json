It went on for a couple of minutes and the meeker one was nearly in tears, so I decided to walk around the other side of the bus stop to take a look at what was going on. When I poked my head around the corner the poor guy was crying but his aggressor was nowhere to be seen, I asked if he was ok to which he said “yeah, don’t worry about him, he’s all talk”. I nodded and turned around just as the nastier man re-emerged to berate his victim… only it wasn’t another person, it was the same guy shouting at himself with an alternate personality. Until you see these things up close you don’t realise how disturbing it must be to suffer from such mental health issues.",

   "message": "England. December, 1999 a few days before Christmas. I was an apprentice in a large industrial bakery. We had teams of temp workers that came in to work around Christmas due to the additional workload. One temp was a woman (late 30s) from Thailand and another was (early 20s) from Spain. For weeks there was tension between them and on the final day the temps were on shift, it exploded. Full blown fight - fists, kicks, hair pulling. It took forever to tear them apart.\n\nSince Spanish girl instigated and was always the more volatile, the boss decided to send her home right then, agreeing to pay her til the end of the day. She left. Thai lady was allowed to stay until days end, having been a solid worker, never missing a shift and even working extra during her temp period. All went quiet and work resumed until....\n\nA couple of hours later Spanish girl returned and attacked Thai lady with a tree branch. And, no, I don't mean a big stick - THE ENTIRE LIMB OF A FUCKING TREE!! Over six feet long, smaller branches and twigs extending from it. To this day I have no idea how it was possible for her to get it (did she find it on the ground? discover it hanging off a tree and snap it the rest of the way?), I still can't explain how the fuck she entered the building with it, came through the foyer, crossed the bakery floor, wasn't seen by ANYBODY - all I know is I looked up at the last moment and watched this batshit Spanish girl charging at Thai lady like some medieval knight trying to batter down the castle door.\n\nIt was carnage. Sticks and twigs flying everywhere, screaming, Spanish girl was literally fucking ROARING! The problem for her, even though her crazy mind thought she had the ultimate weapon, it was so big and cumbersome she couldn't do much with it, couldn't swing it or anything - so it just became a repeat of the earlier struggle to try and pull her away, only now there was a giant mass of wood to wrestle with too. Police were called, Spanish clown was arrested and Thai lady was yelling at me, \"See! I told you, she CRAZY!\" which, to be fair, she had done multiple times over the days before.\n\nEpilogue: About 6 months later outside a McDonald's, I bumped into wacky Spanish woman again. First time I had seen her since that day. She called my name and tried to carry on normal conversation, as if the last time we saw each other she hadn't literally tried to assault somebody with A TREE! I made excuses and got away from her real fast.\n\ntldr: I once saw a crazy lady fight another woman with a tree.",

Wife had the sign asking for money. The Dad sat back watching them like a hawk. \n\nMy wife goes to give them money, I say No, we'll buy you food. Anyone hungry?\n\nThere was a Burger King right there. Kids light up, Dad says NO! We just ate, need gas money. \n\nI lean in, quietly tell him I'm feeding the kids, wife can have some too if she's not scared. But if he tells the kids No, his day gonna get worse. \n\nSo we take the kids inside, let them order everything they want. We watch these kids horrible lives melt away for a minute. \n\nKnowing the junkie parents weren't going to feed them again that day, I suggest lets get \"their parents\" two kids meals to go. \n\nFor their folks, OR if they get hungry later. \n\nKids walk out all happy and innocent, hand the bag of food to the Mom. And the junkie Dad grabs it and empties it on to the street.",
