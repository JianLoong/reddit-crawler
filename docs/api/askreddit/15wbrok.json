Tried to be normal and have friends and whatnot, and I do have a large group of friends that enjoy my company it seems, but I still feel very alone when around these people. Still very estranged. They've done good things for me so I can never hate them, but I just always feel so odd when around them and everyone really. I really hate it. I don't know how to accept me being me without trying to be someone else.",

She will talk over me then follow up with \"speak up!\" It was confusing. Made me very shy. I pretty much lost the confidence to speak up for myself. I love my mom. She did the best she did with what she had. I don't blame her. But at the age of 35 I still struggle to speak up. Sometimes I will just shut down. I'm still working on it with lots of therapy.",

All of my past mistakes, accomplishments, and experiences have shaped me into the man I am today.\n\nI am independent and was able to take care of myself at an early age because I had to. There was nobody there to do it for me. I know how to fight because it was either learn to defend myself or get my ass kicked all the time growing up. I always take care of my financial obligations first before anything else because I know what it is like to be homeless.\n\nThere is a ton more things that I have done or that has happened to me that has helped to shape who I am today. I have had a very interesting life thus far. If I was given the opportunity to go back in time and change something, I would decline. I have done many things I'm not proud of and I have been through some seriously traumatic events but those events all taught me a lesson. I would also be scared that I would have never met my wife or fathered my two amazing kids if I changed anything. Butterfly effect and all that.",
