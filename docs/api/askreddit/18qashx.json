   "message": "I could list a few things, but in many respects they're not really new.  \n\nThe methods may have improved, such as the ability to track, profile, target demographics and feed messages to those people, but then many people seem quite happy with echo chambers and being told what they want to hear. Often they'll get angry at anyone different who dares to speak differently.  \n\nDifferent is not welcome.  \n\nI don't honestly think things have radically changed. I see it as more of the same. An evolution maybe, but not radically different.  \n\nFor example, my above comment about feeding messages to targeted demographics is nothing new. The newspapers do that daily and have been for a very long time.  \n\nThe sensationalism about things being more dangerous is just a way to lock people into a source of news, a way to make money from them via advertising, etc.  \n\nPeople have been tapping into that method with conspiracy theories. There are many people who make up content targeting conspiracy theory believers. The content creators make money through advertising. It's big money. The content creators may not believe the conspiracies. They may privately think that the believers are idiots. But as I said, it's an easy way to make money by giving people what they want to hear.  \n\nThat's the prime way of engaging potential customers.  \n\n*Tell them what they want to hear.*  \n\nThen through page impressions, clicks, etc. you rake in the advertising money.  \n\nI remember one person who made QAnon based content who said that he saw it as providing a service to those who believe the conspiracies. He didn't believe any of it himself. It made him good money through advertising. When asked if he saw himself as contributing towards the current state of America, especially with the likes of Pizzagate and the attack on the Capitol, he said no, he was just providing a service.  \n\nOthers do it for power. See for example wealthy and influential people, groups, politicians, parties, etc. who tell people what they want to hear as a way of seizing and/or retaining power and influence and making even more money.",
