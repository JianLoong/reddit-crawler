   "message": "The murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in West Cork in 1996. There's a guy everyone thinks did it but the police totally botched the investigation, destroyed or lost evidence and even tried to bribe a guy with drugs to wear a wire around the suspect. Said suspect was convicted in absentia by a French court, but their legal system had a lower burden of proof in this case and no defence was mounted. The main suspect still lives in the area and has sort of made a career out of being a suspected killer for two decades.\n\n\nCheck out the podcast West Cork.",
