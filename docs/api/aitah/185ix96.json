 "title": "AITA for refusing to get my MIL a Christmas gift this year?",
 "selftext": "\n\nMy Mil has her birthday on the 27th December and always makes a massive fuss that we can‚Äôt mention Christmas on the 27th and it‚Äôs just got to be about her birthday. (Decorations etc all have to come down and she won‚Äôt ask the kids what they got for Christmas or anything about Christmas at all on that day!)\nLast year I got a large Christmas bonus and wanted to get everybody something lovely. she really likes designer bags so I got her one she has always wanted which was more than four times the cost of everyone else‚Äôs gifts.. so to justify it I needed it to be a Christmas/ birthday gift. \nOn Christmas Day last year I gave her the wrapped gift and explained that it was a joint Christmas and birthday gift and she would understand why when she opened it‚Ä¶ well, she refused to open it. She put it to the side and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll open it on my birthday else I‚Äôll have nothing to open will I‚Äù‚Ä¶ I was due to work on the 27th so wouldn‚Äôt be at her birthday and said I‚Äôd really like to see her open it as it‚Äôs a special gift. She said ‚Äúyou know how I feel about my birthday being so close to Christmas and how awful it is for me and you‚Äôve done this on purpose to spoil Christmas for me‚Äù ‚Ä¶ she then gave me the gift back and stormed off.. she spent the rest of the afternoon shut in her room sobbing. (Loudly!!)\nHer husband told me to go and get her something else for her birthday, but I said no. )maybe I‚Äôm the AH here!) .. I told my husband I was done with doing the present shopping for her and he can do it from now on‚Ä¶ he hasn‚Äôt got her anything yet for this year for either Christmas or her birthday and I‚Äôm not going to help choose anything‚Ä¶ as I‚Äôm typing this I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm probably the AH as I just don‚Äôt think she deserves anything for acting the way she did ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.. but my husband is rubbish as gifting , so AITA for refusing to help and knowing she will probably end up with no gift at all?",

Rather than him telling you off when you did something so kind, he should be telling his wife how rude she's being to you and ask her to apologize to you! Your husband should also be correcting his parents' childish behavior. They should apologize to you. FIL's behavior rings narcissist enabler to me, just saying. Anyways, you did nothing wrong. That's so nice you tried to give her something so awesome. Now let hubs deal with her gifts and def don't go get her anything for this year. She returned it to you, so no gifts. Hubs should have been dealing with his parents' gifts all along and should be solely responsible for it going forward. Her behavior is beyond entitled and embarrassing. And again, it's not about her bday being on a holidqy, it''s about her being a child woman.",

She could have opened it, seen what it was, and would obviously have been over the moon and understood. But she chose to rude and ungrateful and entitled. She could even have opened it and if she still didn't think it was 'special' enough for a joint present then she could have been disappointed (although she shouldn't coz she should be grateful for the gift) but if she was that put out after opening it thats her choice. \nBut she chose to ruin it for herself and everyone else by storming off and moaning at you and not even opening it. And didn't even save it for her birthday. She just handed it back to you. \n\nYou MUST return the bag and get a refund. She does not deserve that gift anymore. \n\nBut like others have said, I'd take a picture of it so you can send it to her in a group chat and say something like ' this year I wanted to get you (MIL) something extra special, which is a lot more money than I'd normally spend, which is why I explained it had to be a joint Xmas and birthday gift. But as I knew it was something special you wanted, I was willing to spend that extra to get you this special gift. However, even after explaining it was an extra dpecial gift, you flatly refused to even open it, were extremely rude and hurtful to my feelings, and extremely ungrateful for the thought and effort and money I spent on you. As you clearly didn't want it, and felt it was so terrible of me to have bought you an extra special joint gift, I've returned it to the shop, so you don't need to worry anymore. I won't do it ever again. This is what I had got you just so you can see what the big deal was about.
