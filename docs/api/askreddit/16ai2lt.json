You need to pay the \"interest\" of R1,500 and the initial loan of R5,000 at one time to pay off the entire loan. If you can't pay it back in one shot you simply pay the \"interest\" of R1,500, indefinitely.  \n\n\nThis poor lady had paid back approximately R25,000 (in \"interest\") over the course of a year of so and still owed R6,500 if she wanted to be free of her debt.  \n\n\nCompletely fucked up.",

Definitely not free. \n\nBut you should also know about our complete line of Christmas ornaments and memorial jewelry with your loved ones fingerprint on it!
