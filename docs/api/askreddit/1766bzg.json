For context i grew up on a farm around horses and cows.\n\nFlash forward to last year.  Im at a bar having a beer with my wife and our friends when i stated this obvious fact in casual conversation.\n\nEverybody at our table stopped everything and stared at me with a confused look.  My wife put her hand on my shoulder and said, \"oh my sweet summer child....\"  its been a year and the shame still haunts me.  Randomly my wife will just burst in to hysterical laughter and while wiping away tears ask me to explain where donkeys come from.   I can only hope in time my children will respect me once more.

   "message": "When I was a kid, maybe three or four years old. I was in the car with my dad, and he spit gum out of the window onto the street. I told him that \"That's bad, that's littering!\" My dad told me specifically that gum wasn't littering because birds will use it in their nests. I had no reason not believe my dad, I was a very young child, and he was a literal *zookeeper* so somewhere in the back of my brain that became a truth. Just something that I inherently knew to be true. \n\nCut to fifteen years later, I'm driving with my girlfriend and I spit gum out of the car (the same car as it would happen) as I had done hundreds, maybe thosands of times since the first story. She looks at me, and tells me that I shouldn't do that, because it's littering. I laugh, and tell her that that's silly because birds will use gum in their nests. But I don't quite get the whole sentence out. As I said it, I knew it sounded ridiculous, but I had never re-exanmined that thought since that day. \n\nIt wasn't a truth I had built my life on, but it was such a weird feeling to realize that I had been Calvin's Dad'd without realizing it.",

Setting of a chain of events that starts the first world war.\nWW1 was started because of a sandwich.\n\nBut that story isn't true. Princip was one of several conspirators lined up in various parts of the expected route. The first conspirator lost his nerve and did nothing, the second threw a bomb at the motorcade, blowing up the wrong car and injuring several people.\n\nThe Duke escaped, did his scheduled speech, and desired aftwards to go see the injured guards at the hospital. His driver, however, was never informed to take the new route and just continued the existing planned route. In doing so, he drove the Duke right past were Princip's was waiting at his assigned position. Princip then did what he was set there to do.\n\nPrincip's assigned spot was situated near a delicatessin and that is probably how the story evolved over the years to add the sandwich bit. Regardless, the point is that it wasn't a twist of fate that he wandered right into the Duke's path because he was hungry. Which is the Crux of the story.",

   "message": "That the water will go down the toilet differently once you cross the equator.\n\nI first heard it in a 2nd or 3rd grade science class. The teacher suggested that if you were on a ship you could actually tell you crossed the equator. \n\nNo. It's a myth. Toilets are too small to exhibit the Coriolis effect. I even perpetuated this myth to others. Many years later I was GENUINELY SHOCKED my science teacher lied to me.",
