She has cried by seeing a dead raccoon on the side of the road before.\n\nAt the time, I was working day shift and she was working a swing shift. I had a busy day, but I saw she sent me some pictures of a young doe that was eating in our front yard. She seemed thrilled. I came home and saw the same deer! Dead. On my god damned porch. I felt like I started to hear ‚Äúthe first 48‚Äù theme playing as I realized I have six hours to get rid of this thing before my wife gets home and her world is shattered. I call my local city authorities thinking they wouldn‚Äôt want a dead animal in the middle of town. Turns out, they couldn‚Äôt care less. I called some local raptor shelters to see if they could take a stat donation but it turns out the dead deer business is booming and they didn‚Äôt have a need for donations at this time, especially in the next 6 hours.\n\nFrustrated, I call my dad to vent and get advice on what to do. His response is only a ‚ÄúHold on bud, I‚Äôll be there in 15 minutes.‚Äù I go back inside to take care of the dogs and within the next 15 minutes I see me dad back his huge truck into my back yard, has the tail gait down and is knocking on my door with a pair of nitrile gloves on and another pair in hand for me. It was starting to get dark out, but we had that thing loaded up and found a special place to, uh. ‚ÄúDispose‚Äù is it. We made it back with 20 minutes to spare before my wife got home.\n\nI haven‚Äôt told my wife because I think it would either break her heart, or creep her out at how efficiently my dad can dump a body.\n\nAnyway, wifey thinks her deer friend is alive and well, and totally not at the bottom of a ravine.",

   "message": "One year for Christmas, she was trying to surprise me with something, but I hate surprises. I was out of a job at the time and didn't want anything extreme because I knew I couldn't return the favor. I told myself I wouldn't snoop, just ask a few questions and express that I didn't want anything big bc poor. She decided to try and casually ask me if I was still interested in a concert for my favorite band, and I immediately knew. Her face gave it away. I knew she got tickets, but it was more. She got us meet and greet tickets, and I found out a few days later after her face kept giving it away. Christmas came and I was right. But I didn't need to act, I was really happy. It was an amazing gift, and we had an amazing time. She was so proud of herself for pulling it off without telling me. I'll never tell her I knew, just because she was so happy.",

   "message": "That she needs to understand her limitations. She's a wonderful, amazing, beautiful person, but she's not the brightest. She's failed community college twice but wants to get a doctorate. This is not a matter of her not putting in good effort or having resources, but her abilities. She's enrolled again in community college and is taking the pre requests before she can do college allegebra and English for credit. The amount of effort it takes to explain something to her is significant. But the amount of effort it takes to get her to apply or remember it is... Yeah.\n\nShe has high goals and I don't want to crush her spirit. She's good at so many things and I know she can be successful in other ways. I will help her to the best of my ability, but I can't take exams for her. There's no way I can have the \"be realistic\" conversation without being a jerk or crushing her dreams",
