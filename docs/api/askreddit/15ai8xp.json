My friend immediately ran after me to help me, when I felt better we went back to the sofa and the place where I was sitting was covered in blood, it was a VERY expensive WHITE sofa! Later I noticed that all my pants were also covered in blood, we were very scared and called an ambulance, I thought that I would die now, because blood was pouring out of me, my friend started crying and screaming and I repeated after him. Later, an ambulance came to us, we showed them that blood was coming from me, you should have seen their FACES, I remembered them for the rest of my life. They told me it was my period, explained what it was, my parents are very Christian and didn't tell me about it. Therefore, the ambulance just left and we all calmed down, but my parents had to pay for cleaning the sofa and we still communicate with a friend, this is both a shameful and funny story",

He told me the smell was coming from my private parts, and he was VERY angry at me because he assumed I wasn’t washing with soap. I was, washing with soap. After my dad continuously screamed, belittled, yelled, and berated me I started to wash my private parts HEAVILY, 2 times a day. Which lead me to get a yeast infection and made me smell worse. So we went to a gynecologist and the doctor told me dad that it could be my sweat glands causing the smell, but my dad didn’t believe him. My dad forced me to let him watch me bathe every day to make sure I was using soap. I still smelled because I was producing sweat uncontrollably in the day and it didn’t matter if I washed, I needed deodorant. After frantically scouring the internet for answers to why I smelled I found out it was my armpits, and I needed deodorant. I begged my dad to buy me some but he just berated me more. He didn’t have any medical condition like an allergy or smth so he should have been fine buying the deodorant but nooo. He screamed at me telling me he couldn’t stand the smell of it and I didn’t need it. Fast forward like 6 months of more abuse from him for this and he finally buys it. And lo and behold, I don’t fucking smell anymore. The feeling of absolute disgust and self loathing and fear my dad put me through, made me so ashamed of myself, my 10 year old body, he legitimately made me want to kill myself because I honestly had no fucking clue what was going on. I can never get over those 6 months.",
