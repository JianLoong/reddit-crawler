   "message": "I (51 yr old M) have heard for a long time from women (friends and strangers writing op-eds) about the notion that hetero men THINK they want to partner with a strong woman...but they don't, actually. Many men want a fantasy version of a strong woman, someone who is strong when it's convenient, but who is still available to be what a man needs/wants her to be when he needs and wants it. And honestly I think this dynamic is true in a lot of relationships I've observed (and, sadly, I've realized it's been true in some of my own, as I've learned and grown).\n\nHowever, there's a dynamic that goes the other way that I also think is common, and not much talked about. Hetero women THINK they want to partner with a man who can express his emotions and be vulnerable...but they don't, actually. Many women want a fantasy version of an expressive man, someone who expresses emotions and vulnerabilities that these women know how to handle, when it's convenient for them to be expressed. Many women are not really prepared for actual masculine vulnerability, which is often at odds with the fantasy of \"Strong, supportive male partner who always has a shoulder available for crying on.\" Actual masculine vulnerability is often about how burdensome and tiring it can be to BE that person. And many (not all, but many) hetero women find that threatening, in the same way that men are threatened by the actuality of feminine strength.\n\nI don't mean this in an accusatory way, but I think about it a lot--especially when I hear the growing sentiment these days (from op-eds and comedians and SNL skits) that men NEED MORE MALE FRIENDS. That may be true for some men--but I suspect these sentiments are also a byproduct of men actually trying to communicate with their partners in ways they thought they'd been encouraged to, only to find their partners resistant or even repulsed.\n\nTL;DR: gender roles are more powerful and restrictive than people suppose--even those who try to break out of them.\n\n(minor edits for clarity)\n\nLater: well, this blew up into a much bigger thing than I'd have ever guessed. Thanks for your comments, everyone. I'm leaving this as I wrote it, but I would stress that I don't mean ALL women and ALL men are like this, or that ALL relationships are subject to these dynamics. I do think a lot of hetero American relationships are, and probably more than we realize, even when we're trying to be good and open and loving with one another. That's the TL;DR I should have gone with.",

   "message": "When you're 14, you assume women are aroused sexually by the same things men are, like physical attractiveness. It's a factor, but nowhere near as important to women as men. Confidence attracts them the best but that's a minefield for them too because a lot of abusers come off as \"confident\" because they lack a full-range of empathy and think they're great. You don't want someone who thinks they're great and gets mad at you for even insinuating they're not.",

I was always told that “men don’t get enough compliments” and that “men are DYING for positive reinforcement!” But it really blew up on my face when I connected with a guy who couldn’t take all the positivity. It taught me that men don’t always want from me what I want from them.",
