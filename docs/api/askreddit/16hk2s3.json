Selling the console will cause resentment, so don't do that.\n\nI say you talk to them and present 3 options.  \n1: Sell the console to pay it back.  (Let them choose)\n2: Refund it and get the account banned.  \n3: Ground them until they pay half back, with the other half still coming.  If they work by mowing lawns or raking leaves or shoveling snow, it'll be paid back quickly. \n\nOf course you can negotiate the options available too if they have their own ideas but don't get soft.

The age of the kid might also determine whether other games get included in the restriction—if they’re old enough to know about money and who it belongs to, their misdeed was more serious than a little kid just pushing buttons without understanding the numbers next to them.\n\nThen I wake up and remember I’m childfree and wouldn’t have encouraged a kid to play Fortnite anyway.",
