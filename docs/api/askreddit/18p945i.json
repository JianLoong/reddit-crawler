He still constantly tried to interject politically charged snide comments which we immediately shut down.\n\nWe just wanted to have family gatherings with no politics.  This apparently infuriated him that he couldn't use those gatherings as his own personal Trump rally.\n\nIt all came to a head a few years later.  We were done.  So sick of it.  I physically removed him from the house and into the yard.  He was told that he was no longer allowed to attend unless he could keep his mouth shut.  That was on Thanksgiving.  He did not attend the following Christmas which we realized was the nicest, most peaceful holiday we had had in a very long time.\n\nThe following Thanksgiving he returned.  Apparently my sister had finally put her foot down.   I dont think he said more than a few words per gathering after that.   In recent years he has improved thankfully.",
